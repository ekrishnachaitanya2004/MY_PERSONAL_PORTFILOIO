  Mom tried to stop me from going to SRM, saying she knew exactly what would happen. And honestly? She wasn’t wrong. But still, I have to go. Not for studies, not for career—just to see her. Whatever it takes.

Bro, today was something else. My mom sat me down and started her lecture—full emotional talk. No scoldings, no shouting. Just pure emotional damage. She used to hit me like a dog, but these days? She’s upgraded. Now it’s all mind games.

She was trying so hard to convince me not to go to SRM. Dropped so many reasons, one after another.

And you know what?

All nonsense.

Okay, maybe not all nonsense. I hate to admit it, but some of the things she said? Were actually true. Mom has some next-level prediction skills. She literally guessed everything that could happen. And the worst part? Even I agreed with her.

But still—I have to go.

I have to prove her wrong.

Not for studies. Not for career. Not for some big future goal.

Just for her.

Whatever it takes, whatever happens—I will go. Same college. Same campus. Same everything.

Not to waste time. Not for fun. Just to see her.

That’s it. 💙
