  See how stupid I am—overthinking for a whole day, and all she sent was a “Hi.”

Just Read this Before : [Lost Between Dreams and Reality again](../Dream8/)

Heh, look at me. A whole tragic story written down like I was the saddest person alive, acting like the world ended just because she didn’t reply. And today? She just sent a "Hi."

At 2:40 PM, exactly after 24 hours.

One single message.

And suddenly, all that overthinking, all those mind games, all the dream-induced madness—felt kind of stupid.

But now the real problem begins. What does this "Hi" mean?

Is she actually free now and ready to talk? Or is this just some casual formality, a way to not look rude for leaving me on read? Maybe she saw my name in her chat list, felt slightly guilty, and threw out a "Hi" like a scrap to a starving dog. I don’t know. And that’s the problem. I never know.

I had to decide. Should I reply immediately? Should I leave it for a few hours, just like she does? Should I even bother?

I ended up playing it safe. I texted back, "I’ll call you tomorrow," because today was a holiday—Holi. And with all my family members around me, there was no way I could sit and have a proper conversation. But honestly, that was just an excuse. The real reason? I needed time to process this.

See, all this chaos I wrote earlier, all the desperation and waiting, was because of that dream. That dream tricked me, fed me false hope, and made me think she would never reach out. But here I was, one day later, staring at a simple message from her.

I could hear my own voice in my head going, "You idiot, you wrote all that drama just because she didn’t text you for a day? Seriously?" But no, it wasn’t just about the text. It was about what it meant.

I was patient all these years. I waited. I controlled myself. I watched from a distance, convinced that if she wanted to talk, she would. And now? I had proof. She reached out. Even if it was just a "Hi."

So, the plan? Wait. Don’t rush. Don’t overthink. Just breathe.

For now, I’ll do what I’ve always done—look at her photos, relive the memories, and keep my damn emotions in check. And when tomorrow comes? Well, we’ll see how that plays out.

I'll just send a message tomorrow, just as a reminder. I already know she won’t call—I’d bet on it. I know her better than I know myself. If she really wanted to, she would have done it already. So if that "Hi" was just a way to clear her chat list, I guess I'll know soon enough.
