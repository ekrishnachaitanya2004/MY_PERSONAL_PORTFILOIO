  A long journey of over-explaining everything with no end in sight.

Okay, so like I just wanna write this whole thing, and I don’t even know where to start, but I guess I should just start somewhere, right? So, basically, what happened was I was just sitting there, doing my thing, and then BOOM, this idea hit me, and I was like, okay, I gotta write this down before I forget, but then I kinda got distracted, and now I’m here trying to remember what I was even thinking about in the first place. But okay, wait, I think I got it now.

So like, first of all, let me just say that this whole thing is super complicated but also kinda simple at the same time? Like, you ever just think about something and it feels like the easiest thing ever, but then you try to actually explain it, and suddenly it’s like, nope, my brain is just gone? Yeah, that’s me right now. But I’m still gonna try because I really wanna get this all out and make sure I don’t forget anything important, even though I already feel like I forgot half of it. 

Anyway, so I was thinking about how things used to be, like way back, not like old-old times, but just like, you know, a few years ago when everything felt different, and it’s kinda wild how fast things change, like one day you’re just chilling and the next day, boom, everything is different, and you don’t even know when it happened, it just did. And then you try to go back and remember how things were before, and it’s like trying to remember a dream, where you kinda get bits and pieces but also it’s all blurry and weird, and you’re not even sure if you’re remembering it right or if your brain is just making stuff up. 

Also, I just realized that I went on a huge tangent and totally forgot what I was even trying to say in the first place, but whatever, I guess I’ll just keep going and see where this ends up. So yeah, where was I? Oh yeah, things changing and stuff. Like, have you ever just looked at something and been like, wow, I remember when this was completely different, and now it’s just... not? And then you get that weird feeling like you’re in a different timeline or something, but obviously, that’s not possible, but also what if it was? Not saying it is, but just imagine if it was, that would be kinda crazy, right? 

Oh, and another thing I was thinking about is how sometimes you try to do something and it feels like it should be super easy, but then you start doing it and suddenly it’s like, why is this the hardest thing ever? Like when you try to fix something and instead of fixing it, you just make it ten times worse, and now you have a way bigger problem than when you started, and now you’re just sitting there like, great, now what? And then you either try to fix it again and somehow make it even worse, or you just give up and pretend like it never happened. 

Anyway, I feel like I could keep going forever, but I should probably stop at some point, but also I feel like I haven’t even said everything I wanted to say yet, but also I don’t even know what I was trying to say in the first place, so I guess it doesn’t really matter? But yeah, this is basically just me trying to explain something and then getting completely sidetracked and now I don’t even know what I was talking about, but I guess that’s just how it goes sometimes. 

Okay, I think I’m done now. Maybe. Probably. We’ll see.
