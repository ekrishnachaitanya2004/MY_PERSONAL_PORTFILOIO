  One unexpected ring, a moment of false hope, and a flood of realizations—some stories don’t need a villain, just enough silence.

Yesterday, I noticed her following count went up again—from 16 to 17.
I saw that and felt bad.
Too bad.
Funny na?

Here I am, overthinking everything like it’s a goddamn puzzle while she’s out there just… living.

Meanwhile, I’m sitting in this mess—ISRO rejected me, no prep for IELTS, doing nothing, feeling like shit every single day. Honestly, shame on me.

But then, around 7:30 PM, I made a call to her.

I knew she wouldn’t pick up, but I still did it.

Because yeah—I’m mental like that.

She didn’t answer. As expected.

Then Teja called me. I picked it up, pretended to be normal, ended the call within a minute.

Tried focusing on my final review prep for today.

And then… at 8:07 PM, one ring.

From her.

Just one ring.

I thought, “Did she just ring by mistake?”

Then within a minute—she actually called.

I couldn’t believe it. I really thought it was one of those fake dream sequences again.
But it wasn’t.

She said she was busy with training and that’s why she couldn’t talk earlier.
I straight up asked what I’ve been holding in since January:

“As I’m writing IELTS in Egmore, can I meet you?”

But now… I don’t even want to see her.

I haven’t seen her in years, but she still rolls on my mind like she owns it.
And I’m scared if I see her again… I’ll collapse mentally.

So I told her I’m trying to write the exam in Bangalore instead of Chennai.

She replied, “It’s just one day na, come to Chennai.”

But deep down I know—she’s just being polite.
She didn’t want to say:

“Don’t come to Chennai. I’m busy. I don’t want to meet you.”

So she gave excuses—train timings, locations, how I can reach on time…
Just words.

I even recorded the call. I’ll link it here later.

Then, suddenly she said:

“I just reached home. I’ll call you back in 5 minutes.”

And she hung up.

I waited.
Till 11 PM.
No call.

Instead, she posted a story on Instagram—right after that call.
That’s when it hit me.

I figured out what really happened.

She must’ve been calling someone else, opened the dialer, and accidentally tapped my name from the logs.
One accidental ring.

Then she realized I’d seen it.
And out of pressure… she called me back.

That’s it.
It wasn’t because she missed me or wanted to talk.
It was just damage control.

Today, I completed my final review and returned home early, skipping my signature day event.
Still thinking about what happened yesterday.

She posted two stories again today.
But no Snap.
Just… her usual polite self.

Being kind to everyone.
Just like me.
But better.

That feeling keeps me stuck—hoping she’ll call back.
But hope’s a dangerous thing, right?
