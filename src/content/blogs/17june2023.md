  She’s out there, smiling, living a life where I no longer exist. But I’m still here, tracing shadows of our past, searching for pieces of her in a world that moved on without me.

Yesterday, she sent a snap—laughing, enjoying her life without me. Hanging out with her friends like I never even existed. But it’s not her fault. It’s mine.

I stared at the snap for a while, curiosity kicking in. Who were they? Where did she go? I zoomed in, trying to make sense of the details, but these damn Snapchat filters blurred everything, pixelating the image just enough to keep me guessing. Frustrated, I switched tactics. Her friends’ Instagram stories—I had to find something there.

And then I saw it. Her photo.

 She looked so damn beautiful. That effortless smile, the way her hair fell perfectly—like the world was designed to make her glow. And then there was me. I caught my own reflection on the screen, and for a second, shame crawled up my spine. How did I even think she’d ever end up with someone like me? But that wasn’t the point. She was Harshi. My Harshi. I had let her go so she could enjoy her life, and she was doing just that.

Still, my mind wouldn’t rest. My eyes fixated on something in the background of her Instagram story—a board that read *'Kun Pre-Owned Cars.'* That was my clue. I Googled it immediately. Five locations in Chennai popped up. Five possibilities. I opened her location tag and started matching them one by one, checking every detail, cross-referencing like a damn detective. But I found nothing.

That wasn’t enough to stop me. I went back, opened those locations again, this time through Google Street View. If I couldn’t be there in person, I’d walk the roads virtually. And then—there it was. The exact place where she took the photo. So simple. Just connecting the dots in this digital world, a world that makes finding things too damn easy. And that’s why I hate this tech.

She had gone with her friends to *'60/94, Block V, V Block, Anna Nagar, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600040.'* The photo? Taken right beside an apartment named *'Grandeur, 65, Z Block, Kathiravan Colony, Anna Nagar, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600040.'*

I sat back, staring at the screen. I found her. Again. Just like that. Even when I tell myself I need to let go, I keep chasing shadows. It’s ridiculous, isn’t it? How I keep tracking every little detail of a life that I’m no longer a part of. But I guess that’s what happens when you leave someone behind without closure—without a final word, without a reason. You leave them stuck in an endless loop of questions and what-ifs.

Maybe she doesn’t think about me anymore. Maybe she’s happy. Maybe she’s even moved on. But here I am, stuck between the past and present, trying to decode a life that I was forced out of. And the saddest part? It doesn’t even make me angry. It just makes me tired. Exhausted by my own inability to just stop caring.

She’s happy. Let her be. 

That’s all that matters, right?
