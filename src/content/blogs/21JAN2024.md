Lost in a Snap

She just sent another snap. This time, with her friend Ramana.


They look like… well, you know. And for a second, it hit me. Maybe I should just forget her. She’s happy. She’s moved on. Everything seems fine.

That was my first thought.

But then, I kept staring at that photo. Looking at them. At her smile. And suddenly, my mind switched again. She looks really happy. And I should move on.

But why do I feel like crying? Why does it hurt, but without tears?

Her smile—it’s so natural. The kind that makes everything around her shine. And yet, here I am, stuck. My brain just isn’t working.

What do I do now?

People around me are already saying, “Bro, they’re definitely in love.” They think they know everything. But I thought I knew her. She never cared about love. Never once showed interest.

But now… these things… they’re starting to make sense. Maybe everyone is right.

Or maybe they’re just judging what they see.

Why do people always do that? Just look at something and decide the whole story?

Maybe, just maybe—before saying anything, we should think. Just once. Before judging.

There words are Just killing My soal

I know She Never Misuses Her freedom.......
