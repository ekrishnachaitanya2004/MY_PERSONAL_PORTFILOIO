I am Starboy. And she is my Stargirl.

I am The Weeknd. She is Lana Del Rey. The perfect match. The kind of duo that was meant to exist in this universe. I love that she listens to Lana. Because when The Weeknd and Lana collaborate? It’s pure magic.

And now she’s tagging Say Yes to Heaven?

Is she trying to tell me something? Or is my overthinking brain making up stories again? Because if she ever meant those words—if she ever looked at me and said, say yes to heaven, say yes to me—then it’s always, always a yes from me.

Anytime. Any day. Any age.

And if she ever comes back… I’ll still be here. In the same place where we met.

But why is she listening to Lana so much? It’s messing with my head. Making me obsessed all over again. I can’t escape it. I don’t even want to.

She is definitely my Stargirl.

“Stargirl Interlude”-I just wanna see Her shine, ’cause I know she is my Stargirl.
