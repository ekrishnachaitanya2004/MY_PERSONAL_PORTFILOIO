  My heart races at 100 BPM, a silent battle no one notices. High metabolism, stress, restless sleep—it all connects. I must regain control, for my mind and body.

A Silent Battle Within

The one thing that has haunted me for years is my pulse rate. It has never been normal. Not once. Not for a single day. A resting heart rate of 100 BPM—consistently. No one around me seems to care. No one takes it seriously. But I do. Because I know what it means. I know that something isn’t right.

This is not a new discovery. I first measured my pulse in 2017—101 BPM. At the time, I ignored it, thinking maybe it was temporary. But it never changed. Year after year, the numbers remained the same. I spent an entire year swimming, trying to bring it down. Nothing. A mere 90 BPM at best. Still abnormal. Why?

Am I overthinking? Maybe. Or maybe no one else is thinking at all.

The Connection No One Sees

I decided to break this problem apart, analyze it in ways no one else would. And I found something—everything is connected, perfectly interlinked.

My Metabolism:

I’ve always had a high metabolism. My body burns calories too fast, preventing me from gaining weight, from aging normally, from growing the way I should. It sounds like a gift. It isn’t. A metabolism running at full speed means my heart is working overtime, always engaged, always pumping, never resting.

The Pulse Rate:

A heart rate of 100 BPM means my heart beats 100 times per minute, even when I’m resting. That’s 144,000 beats per day—millions more per year than a normal heart should endure. Theoretically, my body should be more efficient because of it. More blood flow, faster oxygen delivery, quicker responses. But at what cost?

The cost is simple: a shorter heart lifespan. The more my heart works now, the less time it will last in the future. I cannot afford that risk.


What they don’t tell you about an abnormal heart rate is how it affects the mind.

A constantly elevated pulse triggers the release of cortisol, the stress hormone. Cortisol keeps the body in a perpetual state of alertness, making it harder to relax, harder to sleep, harder to think clearly. This is why I experience light sleep, frequent awakenings, and—most frustrating of all—bad dreams.

More time in REM sleep means more nightmares. More stress. More exhaustion. It’s a vicious cycle, one that keeps breaking me down mentally while my body appears to function perfectly.

The Only Solution

I need to reset everything. My heart, my stress levels, my sleep. I need to lower my resting heart rate to 75 BPM—no exceptions.

There is only one way to do this: cardio training. Running. There is no pool here. No skating rink. Nothing that would make this process enjoyable. But it doesn’t matter. I have no other option.

I have to run.

This is not just about physical health. This is about taking back control of my own mind. The elevated heart rate, the constant stress, the nightmares—these things have shaped me into someone I don’t recognize. They have altered my emotions, my thoughts, my reality.

I Dont want to let this continue.

I will try --fix this.
