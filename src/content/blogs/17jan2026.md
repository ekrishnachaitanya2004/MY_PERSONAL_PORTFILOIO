  Module Team Research and Development Project - Fail
---

Bro, today is January 16th and everything is just fucked up. I found out I failed a module team project, and I'm not gonna lie, I was so embarrassed that this shit happened today. The most crazy thing is Today Morning I went ahead and left every single group for this semester. In my head, I was like, "I'm done, I'm complete, I don't need them anymore," but now? Everything is just fucked up.

Coming to the point, I've been looking at the significant mistakes I made that led us to fail this module. It's all my fault.

First thing was ignoring the stuff everyone else was focused on—like following the actual module guidance or even just making a simple enquiry about the graphs and the specifics. I was too busy trying to be perfect at the technical things. I honestly thought this module was more about how we collaborate with people in the real tech world rather than the actual context of what we were doing. I was wrong.

I got lazy. I wasn't doing things like I used to, and a few things made me feel that way. Like digging through old shit on GitHub—man, those public repos suck. I feel like a fool for trusting them. I should have been thinking practically. Those guys are just noobs; they don't even know they're supposed to keep their repos private like the module says. Trusting them was just funny and foolish on my part.

And what's worse is seeing most of the other teams just buying their assignments. That's where my laziness peaked. I had this mindset like, "No one else is worried about the assignment, so why should I?" That mentality is exactly why this happened. I even felt like I was losing my interest in CS, man. Why? Why did it get to that?

It's crazy. I was the guy just fucking things up—crazy projects, groups, communities, people, mining, scams, whatever. All of this just reminds me of the bad decisions I made, and I regret it.

**But okay, let's fix this fucking thing.**

I think my uni will give me a chance to make a change in the project. So, let's go through the community and get a crazy assignment done this time. No more laziness, no more trusting noob repos. Let's get it back.
