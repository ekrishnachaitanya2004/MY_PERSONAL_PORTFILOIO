So today, Vishnu — yeah, the same Vishnu a.k.a. son of PVR — followed me.
Now, he’s not new to me. I’ve already written about him before — he’s one of her friends, and there’s some history there.

But this follow request still felt random. I mean, why now?

Interestingly, just 4 days back, another guy named Aghitiya Vishwakumar from SRM followed me. That made me pause — is there some discussion happening around her that I don’t know about?

Curious, I sent Vishnu a simple “?” to understand his intention.
Waited for 2 hours. He saw the message… and didn’t reply.

Okay then, maybe he’s just another one of those guys who spams follow requests. Weird.

But later it started to click. I do check her profile sometimes. And while going through her followers’ stories, I may have viewed his story by accident. Maybe he saw that and assumed we knew each other, so he followed me.

We even had 3 mutuals:
– Harshi
– Her mom
– Parasharan (his schoolmate)

So, maybe it wasn’t that deep.
Just a normal follow, not some hidden agenda.

Still… kind of strange how these things happen back-to-back.
