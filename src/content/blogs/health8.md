  She’s just a call away. But I can’t call her. And I don’t even know why.

I don’t care anymore. No one does. But Jyothi Master did. He noticed something was wrong, took it seriously, and decided to step in like it was some emergency. He came up with a perfect plan—at least in his mind. But I told him straight—I’ve already tried everything to keep it under control. Every single thing.

But he didn’t listen. Just nodded, smiled, and gave me a single order: “Start cardio again.”

I tried explaining. “Master, after 150 rpm while running, I noticed muscle loss. That’s why I stopped a year ago.” I thought he’d understand. But no, he just dismissed it and repeated, “Start again.”

At that moment, I knew I had no choice. So, two weeks ago, I started running again.

And That’s When Everything Went Wrong…

In just two weeks, my whole body, my whole routine, everything just collapsed.

First, the dreams. I don’t even know how to explain them. Every night, I’d get these crazy, intense dreams that made no sense. But the moment I opened my eyes, they’d disappear. Like I could feel something was off, but I couldn’t remember what. It wasn’t like before. Before, I’d at least have a clue. Now? Nothing. Just an empty, weird feeling in my head.

And then, the worst part—I started feeling like a patient. Weak, drained, like something inside me had shifted.

Routine? Completely Destroyed.

I still try to stick to my schedule. At 9 AM, I do strength training. And at 11 AM, I start running. It’s just a 5K run. I used to finish it in 40 minutes. But now? It takes me an entire hour. What happened to me?

And it’s not just about the time. After finishing cardio, my pulse shoots up to 140 rpm. That’s not good. That’s not normal. I know this is going to kill my muscle growth. It’s going to burn my strength down. And I can’t stop worrying about it.

After running, I come back home and just collapse. Some days, I don’t even eat. Just sleep. And when I wake up? It’s 4 PM. Again. Another bad dream.

And now? Something new. Afternoon naps.

I’ve NEVER slept in the afternoon. Not once. Now? I can’t stop it. And I know that’s why I wake up too early. That’s why I feel weak. That’s why my body just doesn’t feel right anymore.

Nothing Makes Sense Anymore.

My resting pulse? 111 rpm. Again. I know it’s not going to drop. I just have to maintain it. That’s the reality.

I understand what’s happening to me. I can see it. I know what I should be doing. But somehow… I just can’t do it.

And now? I’m supposed to be preparing for IELTS. But instead? I’m just sleeping all day.
