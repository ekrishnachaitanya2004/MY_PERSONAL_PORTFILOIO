  Umesh scolded me for taking the TOEFL exam in Tirupati under Dhamodar Reddy’s guidance. It was a disaster, but Dhamodar says I can retake it in a week. Still, I don’t want to decide without her response—yet she hasn’t even seen my message. Now, I’m just stuck and feeling worse.

So today, I woke up feeling all weird and confused, still thinking about the exam, still waiting for her reply. And then Umesh called me.

And oh boy. He wasn’t happy.

The moment I picked up, he just started SCOLDING me like he was my dad or something.

“I TOLD you! Don’t attend TOEFL in Tirupati! And DEFINITELY not with Dhamodar Reddy! How many times do I have to say it?!”

I just sat there, listening, feeling smaller and smaller. Because yeah, maybe he did tell me. But it wasn’t just me who trusted this guy!

Nitheesh told me that Devesh bro ALSO took the TOEFL with Dhamodar’s assistance, and everything went fine for him. So, I thought, “Okay, maybe Umesh is overreacting. Maybe it’ll be okay.”

It was not okay.

It was a total disaster.

And then Dhamodar calls me all chill like nothing happened. “Bro, don’t worry, it’s probably just a technical issue. We can retake it in a week.”

A week? That’s fine, I guess. But the thing is…

I don’t want to move forward without her response.

She still hasn’t read my message. Still hasn’t called back. And I don’t know why, but it feels like I can’t do anything until she does. Like I’m just stuck in this weird pause, waiting for an answer that may never come.

And honestly?

I hate this feeling.
