  A broken leg, a classroom full of eyes, and then her. Harshi. Not a blur, not a dream—just real. And her gesture, telling me to calm down… That moment, that look—I can never forget.

Sometimes, I feel like my dreams are more real than reality. Every detail, every frame—so clear. But no sound. Like watching a muted movie in perfect quality. Yesterday, I had one of those dreams. It felt like I was actually there.

And I just can’t forget it. Even after the whole day.

---

At first, everything is blur. I can’t see properly. But I look down. My legs… they don’t look right. The veins are popping out, like something is broken inside. My hands are shaking. I am crying.

But no pain.

I look up. So many eyes on me. My whole class. Staring. Whispering. I feel strange. I’m sitting on the teacher’s Bench. Why am I here? What’s happening?

And then… I see her.

Harshi.

She’s in the third-last bench. Looking straight at me.

Everything else is still blurry, moving like an illusion. But Harshi… she is clear. Too clear. Like she doesn’t belong in the dream.

For a second, I forget everything. The broken legs, the class staring.

All I can think is—does she feel sad for me? Or not?

And then… I wake up.

But the dream stays with me.

Because it wasn’t just a dream. It was a memory.

4th class. Albin. That idiot. Climbing up a ladder, sliding down with one hand, laughing like a hero. I saw him, and I thought, I can do that too.

So I climbed.

I slid.

And then—twist. Crack. Fall.

Pain. So much pain.

I was on the ground, screaming. My leg was gone. I couldn’t move. Tears. Panic. Everything spinning.

Albin and Abhi picked me up, dragging me to the classroom. One hand on each of their shoulders. I was half-hanging, half-walking.

My mom ran in. Worried. Talking. Trying to calm me down. My teacher made me sit next to her, telling me, “It’s okay, it’s okay.” But I couldn’t stop crying.

And then. Harshi.

She was just sitting there. Not scared. Not shocked. Just watching.

And then she smiled.

Not a big smile. Just a small one. Like she was telling me, “Calm down. It’s fine.” Just with her eyes, her face, her tiny hand gesture.

And somehow, that moment stuck with me.

Even now, after all these years…

I don’t know why. But I can’t forget it.

Maybe because… She is haunting me.

Like a ghost.

But she’s not dead.

Or maybe… the Harshi I knew is.
