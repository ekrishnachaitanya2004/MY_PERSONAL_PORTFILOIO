Reset, Refocus, and No More Excuses

Okay, this is just my monthly reminder blog. Again. Another month gone, another set of plans completely ignored. And this time, I’ve messed up bad.

For the past few months, I’ve done NOTHING right. No schedule, no proper routine, no discipline. I just wasted so much time, and now it’s hitting me. Hard. It’s already too late, but I need to go back offline, at least for a while, to fix things.

First thing—IELTS. I was supposed to take the test months ago. But guess what? I didn’t even prepare. Not even a little bit. It’s not just about postponing the exam—I didn’t even study for it. Shame on me. 3 months just disappeared, and I have NOTHING to show for it. No progress. No results. Nothing. Now, no more excuses. This month, I HAVE to take IELTS and get at least a 7.0 band score. No more delays. No more “I’ll do it later.”

Next—my diet and workouts. Total disaster. I was supposed to fix my routine, but instead, I ended up messing it up even more. I wasted hours at NFC, just sitting around, talking, doing nothing useful. 9 AM to 12 PM, gone, just like that. And now, looking back, I feel so stupid. That was my PRIME TIME. The most productive part of the day. And I threw it away like it was nothing.

Now, I have a new plan. No running this month. No unnecessary distractions. Just strict strength training. I’ll stick to it until IELTS is done. I finally received my supplements, so that’s one thing sorted. Once I finish my refund process, I’ll add a link to this repo for future reference.

And then there’s Vinay. A new friend, seems like a good guy. He asked me to come to NFC in the evening instead—from 5 to 7 PM—so we can train together. I don’t know if that’s a good idea, but I’ll think about it. Maybe I should talk to Manoj Anna first before switching my schedule.

And the biggest problem—SOCIAL MEDIA. It’s ruining my focus. Every month, I say I’ll stop, but then I just go back to the same cycle. This time, no more Instagram. Snapchat? Gone from my phone. I’ll keep it on my browser extension, though. Not because I need it. Just because I don’t want to miss her snaps. Her photos. Her moments. I know it sounds stupid, but I can’t help it.

This month is CRUCIAL. If I don’t fix things now, I never will. Every time I try to get back to my old routine, something distracts me, and the streak is gone. And once the streak is gone, it’s impossible to get it back.

Not this time.

This is it. One last chance to reset, refocus, and do things right.
