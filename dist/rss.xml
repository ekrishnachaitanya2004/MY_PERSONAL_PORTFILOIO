From learning about blockchain, Proof of Work, and mining pools to facing MacOS restrictions and hardware limitations, this experiment turned into a crash course in crypto.

Excited to give mining another shot, I set up my wallet, installed XMRig, and joined a mining pool. But what started as an experiment quickly turned into a battle against overheating, high CPU usage, and painfully low rewards. After hours of mining, I earned just a few cents—barely enough to cover my laptop’s electricity cost. This adventure proved that mining on a regular laptop isn’t worth it, but the experience? A priceless lesson in crypto mining.</description><pubDate>Sat, 12 Feb 2022 01:56:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Mining Dreams, Government Screams - The Great Indian Krypto Struggle</title><link>https://krishnaethamukkala.me/blog/Crypto-4</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://krishnaethamukkala.me/blog/Crypto-4</guid><description>“Bro, in India, if you want to start something innovative, first you need to mine through government rules before mining crypto.
